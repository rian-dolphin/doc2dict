There are five matters on the agenda: the election of</p></div><div class="section"><p>directors, Say-on-Pay, advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation,</p></div><div class="section"><p>ratification of the auditors, and one stockholder proposal.</p></div><div class="section"><p>At Visa, we are guided by our purpose, which is to uplift everyone, everywhere by being the best way to pay and</p></div><div class="section"><p>be paid. Our purpose is demonstrated in our business and in our environmental, social, and governance (ESG)</p></div><div class="section"><p>efforts, which are an important priority for Visa and continue to be an increasing focus for our investors, partners,</p></div><div class="section"><p>and employees, as well as governments and other stakeholders.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our Board oversees our ESG strategy and activities at both the full Board and committee levels, with the</p></div><div class="section"><p>Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee having formal responsibility for oversight of our ESG policies</p></div><div class="section"><p>and programs. Throughout the year, we made significant progress across each of our five ESG pillars:</p></div><div class="section"><p>Empowering People & Economies, Securing Commerce & Protecting Customers, Investing in Our Workforce,</p></div><div class="section"><p>Protecting the Planet, and Operating Responsibly. Some highlights across these pillars include:</p></div><div class="section"><p>• We have helped digitally enable over 40 million small and micro businesses as of September 2022, as</p></div><div class="section"><p>we work toward our goal of reaching 50 million by the end of 2023.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• We have invested over $10 billion in technology over the last five years, including to reduce fraud and</p></div><div class="section"><p>enhance network security.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• We achieved the highest rating in our sector from Gartner Consulting during our 2022 cybersecurity</p></div><div class="section"><p>program review.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• We supported more than 6,000 employees from 58 countries who volunteered more than 55,000 hours to</p></div><div class="section"><p>strengthen the communities in which we live and work.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• We completed the first year of the Visa Black Scholars and Jobs Program, hosted the inaugural Visa</p></div><div class="section"><p>Black Scholars Summit, and welcomed our second cohort of scholars to continue building on the</p></div><div class="section"><p>momentum of the program.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• We received third party validation of our 2030 science-based target as an interim goal toward our 2040</p></div><div class="section"><p>net zero target. This builds on Visa’s achievement of purchasing 100% renewable electricity and attaining</p></div><div class="section"><p>carbon neutrality for our operations in 2020.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• We advanced on our aspiration to be a climate positive company through expanded sustainability</p></div><div class="section"><p>solutions, such as the Visa Eco Benefits bundle, for our clients.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• We continued to receive recognition of our ESG leadership from third-party organizations, including</p></div><div class="section"><p>inclusion in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for</p></div><div class="section"><p>the fifth consecutive year, and Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical Companies for the tenth consecutive year.</p></div><div class="section"><p>This year, Visa’s corporate governance practices continued to help promote long-term value and strong Board</p></div><div class="section"><p>and management accountability to our diverse set of stakeholders. The Board is focused on prioritizing the right</p></div><div class="section"><p>mix of skills, qualifications, experiences, tenure, and diversity to promote and support Visa’s long-term strategy.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Women comprise 30% of the Board’s nominees, and 40% of the Board’s nominees are racially or ethnically</p></div><div class="section"><p>diverse. During 2022 we welcomed two independent directors to the Board, Teri L. List and Kermit R. Crawford.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Teri and Kermit each bring decades of senior leadership experience to the Board, providing diverse perspectives</p></div><div class="section"><p>and expertise that will be invaluable to Visa. In addition, Mary Cranston and Bob Matschullat will be retiring from</p></div><div class="section"><p>the Board at this year’s Annual Meeting after contributing 15 years of distinguished leadership and service,</p></div><div class="section"><p>including as committee chairs, and with Bob serving as our former Chairman of the Board. On behalf of the</p></div><div class="section"><p>Board, we sincerely thank Mary and Bob for their dedicated service and many contributions to Visa over the</p></div><div class="section"><p>years.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Finally, as we have recently announced, we are pleased to share that Ryan McInerney will be Visa’s next Chief</p></div><div class="section"><p>Executive Officer, and Al Kelly will move to the role of Executive Chairman, both effective February 1, 2023. The</p></div><div class="section"><p>Board of Directors also expects to appoint Ryan to the Board effective upon his transition to Chief Executive</p></div><div class="section"><p>Officer. This leadership change reflects the Board’s thoughtful and well-established approach to succession. Ryan</p></div><div class="section"><p>is a very seasoned leader in the payments and consumer banking industry. In his role as President over the past</p></div><div class="section"><p>10 years, Ryan has been responsible for Visa’s global businesses, delivering value to the company’s financial</p></div><div class="section"><p>institutions, acquirers, merchants, and partners in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. He</p></div><div class="section"><p>has overseen the company’s market teams, business units, product team, merchant team, and client services.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We look forward to working with Ryan to continue to drive Visa’s success, growth, and innovation.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Thank you for your continued support of Visa, and we look forward to your attendance at this year’s Annual Meeting.</p></div><h2>Al Kelly</h2><div class="section"><h3>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</h3><div class="section"></div></div><h2>John Lundgren</h2><div class="section"><h3>Lead Independent Director</h3><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Items of Business</p></div><div class="section"><p>1.

While the Company does not have a policy on whether the roles of Chairperson and Chief</p></div><div class="section"><p>Executive Officer should be split, the Board believes that the combined role is in the best interests of the</p></div><div class="section"><p>Company and its stockholders at this time, as this structure allows Mr. Kelly to effectively manage the business,</p></div><div class="section"><p>execute on our strategic priorities, and lead the Board, while empowering Mr. Lundgren to provide independent</p></div><div class="section"><p>Board leadership and oversight. The Board believes that Mr. Kelly’s inclusive leadership style and decades of</p></div><div class="section"><p>payments expertise make him uniquely qualified to lead discussions of the Board; foster an important unity of</p></div><div class="section"><p>leadership between the Board and management; and promote alignment of the Company’s strategy with its</p></div><div class="section"><p>operational execution. Upon effecting the Chief Executive Officer transition on February 1, 2023, the Board has</p></div><div class="section"><p>determined that Mr. Kelly will continue to serve as Executive Chairman. Mr. Lundgren has significant experience</p></div><div class="section"><p>as a CEO, including in a combined role of CEO and Chair, so he is familiar with the combined board leadership</p></div><div class="section"><p>structure and the importance of building strong relationships with the various constituencies.</p></div><div class="section"><p>To further promote independent leadership, the Board has developed a robust set of responsibilities for the Lead</p></div><div class="section"><p>Independent Director role, including:</p></div><div class="section"><p>• calling, setting the agenda for, and chairing periodic executive sessions and meetings of the independent</p></div><div class="section"><p>directors;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• chairing Board meetings in the absence of the Chairperson or when it is deemed appropriate arising from</p></div><div class="section"><p>the Chairperson’s management role or non-independence;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• providing feedback to the Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer on corporate and Board policies and</p></div><div class="section"><p>strategies and acting as a liaison between the Board and the Chief Executive Officer;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• facilitating communication among directors and between the Board and management;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• in concert with the Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer, advising on the agenda, schedule, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>materials for Board meetings and strategic planning sessions based on input from directors;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• coordinating with the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, leading the</p></div><div class="section"><p>independent directors’ involvement in Chief Executive Officer succession planning, selection of</p></div><div class="section"><p>committee chairs and committee membership, and the Board evaluation process;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• coordinating with the Chair of the Compensation Committee and leading the independent directors’</p></div><div class="section"><p>evaluation of Chief Executive Officer performance and compensation;</p></div><div class="section"><p>10</p></div><div class="section"><p>• communicating with stockholders as necessary; and</p></div><div class="section"><p>• carrying out such other duties as are requested by the independent directors, the Board, or any of its</p></div><div class="section"><p>committees from time to time.</p></div><div class="section"><p>The Board periodically reviews the Board’s leadership structure and its appropriateness given the needs of the</p></div><div class="section"><p>Board and the Company at such time.</p></div><div class="section"><p>In addition to our Lead Independent Director, independent directors chair the Board’s four standing committees:</p></div><div class="section"><p>the Audit and Risk Committee, chaired by Lloyd A.

The Board also conducts</p></div><div class="section"><p>an annual peer review, which is designed to assess individual director performance. The Nominating and</p></div><div class="section"><p>Corporate Governance Committee, in conjunction with the Lead Independent Director, oversees the evaluation</p></div><div class="section"><p>process.</p></div><h5>Review of Evaluation</h5><div class="section"></div><h5>Process</h5><div class="section"></div><h5>Advanced</h5><div class="section"></div><h5>Questionnaire</h5><div class="section"></div><h5>One-on-One</h5><div class="section"></div><h5>Discussion Evaluation Results</h5><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>NCGC reviews evaluation</p></div><div class="section"><p>process annually</p></div><div class="section"><p>Covers:</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Board efficiency and</p></div><div class="section"><p>effectiveness</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Board and committee</p></div><div class="section"><p>composition</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Quality of board discussions</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Quality of information and</p></div><div class="section"><p>materials provided</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Board processes</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Board culture</p></div><div class="section"><p>One-on-one discussions between</p></div><div class="section"><p>independent, third-party facilitator</p></div><div class="section"><p>and each director to solicit their</p></div><div class="section"><p>views on the Board’s effectiveness</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Preliminary evaluation results</p></div><div class="section"><p>are discussed with the NCGC</p></div><div class="section"><p>Chair, Board Chair, and Lead</p></div><div class="section"><p>Independent Director</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Final evaluation results and</p></div><div class="section"><p>recommendations are</p></div><div class="section"><p>discussed with the Board,</p></div><div class="section"><p>committees, and individual</p></div><div class="section"><p>directors</p></div><div class="section"><p class="textsmall">Feedback Incorporated</p></div><div class="section"><p>Over the past few years, the evaluation process has led to a broader scope of topics covered in the Board meetings,</p></div><div class="section"><p>improvements in Board process, and changes to Board and committee composition and structure.</p></div><div class="section"><p>This year’s evaluation identified areas for continued focus, including:</p></div><div class="section"><p>‰ management, director, and committee succession planning;</p></div><div class="section"><p>‰ enhancements to support board effectiveness;</p></div><div class="section"><p>‰ risk management; and</p></div><div class="section"><p>‰ Board composition in support of long-term strategy.</p></div></div></div><h4>Director Succession Planning and Board Refreshment</h4><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>In addition to executive and management succession, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee</p></div><div class="section"><p>regularly oversees and plans for director succession and refreshment of the Board to cultivate a mix of skills,</p></div><div class="section"><p>experience, tenure, and diversity that promote and support the Company’s long-term strategy. In doing so, the</p></div><div class="section"><p>11</p></div><div class="section"><p>Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee takes into consideration the overall needs, composition, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>size of the Board, as well as the criteria adopted by the Board regarding director candidate qualifications, which</p></div><div class="section"><p>are described in the section entitled Committees of the Board of Directors – Criteria for Nomination to the Board</p></div><h5>of Directors and Diversity</h5><div class="section"><div class="section"></div><div class="section"><p>qualified to become directors are then recommended to the Board for nomination or election.</p></div></div></div><h4>Independence of Directors</h4><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>The NYSE’s listing standards and our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a majority of our Board and</p></div><div class="section"><p>every member of the Audit and Risk, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees</p></div><div class="section"><p>must be “independent.” Our Certificate of Incorporation further requires that at least 58% of our Board be</p></div><div class="section"><p>independent. Under the NYSE’s listing standards, our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and our Certificate of</p></div><div class="section"><p>Incorporation, no director will be considered to be independent unless our Board affirmatively determines that</p></div><div class="section"><p>such director has no direct or indirect material relationship with Visa or our management. Our Board reviews the</p></div><div class="section"><p>independence of its members annually and has adopted guidelines to assist it in making its independence</p></div><div class="section"><p>determinations. For details, see our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which can be found on the Investor</p></div><div class="section"><p>Relations page of our website at investor.visa.com under “Corporate Governance.”</p></div><div class="section"><p>In October 2022, with the assistance of legal counsel, our Board conducted its annual review of director</p></div><div class="section"><p>independence and affirmatively determined that each of our non-employee directors (Lloyd A.

In this regard, the Board considered that certain directors serve as directors of</p></div><div class="section"><p>other companies with which the Company engages in ordinary-course-of-business transactions, and that, in</p></div><div class="section"><p>accordance with our director independence guidelines, none of these relationships constitute material</p></div><div class="section"><p>relationships that would impair the independence of these individuals. Discretionary contributions to certain</p></div><div class="section"><p>charitable organizations with which some of our directors are affiliated also were considered, and the Board</p></div><div class="section"><p>determined that the amounts contributed to each of these charitable organizations in the past fiscal year were less</p></div><div class="section"><p>than $120,000 and that these contributions otherwise created no material relationships that would impair the</p></div><div class="section"><p>independence of those individuals.</p></div><div class="section"><p>In addition, each member of the Audit and Risk Committee and the Compensation Committee meets the</p></div><div class="section"><p>additional, heightened independence criteria applicable to such committee members under the applicable NYSE</p></div><div class="section"><p>rules.</p></div></div><h4>Executive Sessions of the Board of Directors</h4><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>The non-employee, independent members of our Board and all committees of the Board generally meet in</p></div><div class="section"><p>executive session without management present during their Board and committee meetings.

The Corporate</p></div><div class="section"><p>Secretary will review the matter with the Lead Independent Director or the Chair of the Board, the Chair of the</p></div><div class="section"><p>Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and the Chief Executive Officer, so that the Board, through</p></div><div class="section"><p>the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, has the opportunity to review the director’s ability to</p></div><div class="section"><p>continue to fulfill his or her responsibilities as a member of the Company’s Board or Audit and Risk Committee.</p></div><div class="section"><p>When reviewing such a request, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider a number</p></div><div class="section"><p>of factors, including the director’s other time commitments, record of attendance at Board and committee</p></div><div class="section"><p>meetings, potential conflicts of interest and other legal considerations, and the impact of the proposed directorship</p></div><div class="section"><p>or audit committee service on the director’s availability.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Mr. Carney serves as chief acquisition officer of Carney Technology Acquisition Corp.

While the Board does not have a formal policy on diversity, the</p></div><div class="section"><p>Board’s practice in assembling the Board is to have wide diversity in terms of business experiences, functional</p></div><div class="section"><p>skills, gender, race, ethnicity, and cultural backgrounds. To support this objective, the Nominating and Corporate</p></div><div class="section"><p>Governance Committee considers women and candidates from underrepresented groups in the pool from which</p></div><div class="section"><p>the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers director candidates.</p></div><div class="section"><p>28</p></div></div></div><h3>COMPENSATION OF NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS</h3><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>We compensate non-employee directors for their service on the Board with a combination of cash and equity</p></div><div class="section"><p>awards, the amounts of which are commensurate with their role and involvement, and consistent with peer</p></div><div class="section"><p>company practices. In setting non-employee director compensation, we consider the significant amount of time</p></div><div class="section"><p>our directors expend in fulfilling their duties as well as the skill level required of members of our Board. Mr. Kelly,</p></div><div class="section"><p>our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, does not receive additional compensation for his service as a director.</p></div><div class="section"><p>The Compensation Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors, has the primary responsibility</p></div><div class="section"><p>for reviewing and considering any revisions to our non-employee director compensation program. In July 2021,</p></div><div class="section"><p>the Compensation Committee undertook its annual review of non-employee director compensation for fiscal year</p></div><div class="section"><p>2022, which included an analysis completed by its independent compensation consultant. As part of this analysis,</p></div><div class="section"><p>the independent compensation consultant reviewed trends and data from the same peer companies used by the</p></div><div class="section"><p>Compensation Committee in connection with its review of executive compensation. Pursuant to the review, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>after considering the independent compensation consultant’s advice on peer group data, the Compensation</p></div><div class="section"><p>Committee recommended that the Board approve an increase in the grant date value of the annual equity grant</p></div><div class="section"><p>for non-employee directors from $215,000 to $225,000 for grants made on or after the date of the 2022 Annual</p></div><div class="section"><p>Meeting of Stockholders.

The scorecard balances annual incentive determinations across financial and</p></div><div class="section"><p>non-financial strategic priorities, with rigorous, pre-established quantitative and qualitative corporate performance</p></div><div class="section"><p>goals in four categories. The Compensation Committee established the goals early in the fiscal year, reviewed</p></div><div class="section"><p>progress against each goal quarterly, and evaluated achievement of the goals at year-end.

The</p></div><div class="section"><p>Compensation Committee expects our NEOs to be focused on a wide range of performance goals that are critical</p></div><div class="section"><p>to our corporate strategy, by promoting financial goals along with other priorities that are vital to the Company’s</p></div><div class="section"><p>long-term success, such as ESG initiatives. This approach is aligned with our corporate strategy, enhances</p></div><div class="section"><p>stockholder value, and reduces the likelihood of excessive risk taking with respect to any particular financial</p></div><div class="section"><p>performance goal. Accordingly, the scorecard design takes a holistic approach to the goal-setting process and</p></div><div class="section"><p>does not apply specific weighting to the corporate performance goals described below, and the Compensation</p></div><div class="section"><p>Committee carefully considered each goal in its overall evaluation of corporate performance.

It is our policy that NEOs are responsible for all income taxes related to</p></div><div class="section"><p>their personal usage of the Company car or corporate aircraft, as well as travel by their companions. Additionally,</p></div><div class="section"><p>no NEO may use the corporate aircraft for exclusive personal use (not related to business) except under the</p></div><div class="section"><p>terms and conditions outlined in the Company’s aircraft time-sharing agreement with the Chairman and Chief</p></div><div class="section"><p>Executive Officer, or under extraordinary circumstances with the advance approval of the Chairman and Chief</p></div><div class="section"><p>Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee requires that Mr. Kelly use the aircraft for all business and</p></div><div class="section"><p>63</p></div><div class="section"><p>personal travel, based on an independent third-party finding of a bona fide security concern, which recommended</p></div><div class="section"><p>that Mr. Kelly use the aircraft for all travel. Related to this requirement, Mr. Kelly is required under the terms of the</p></div><div class="section"><p>aircraft time-sharing agreement to reimburse Visa for personal use of the aircraft for amounts in excess of</p></div><div class="section"><p>$200,000 per fiscal year. Any personal use of the aircraft in excess of this limit by our Chairman and Chief</p></div><div class="section"><p>Executive Officer pursuant to the aircraft time-sharing agreement requires him to reimburse Visa an amount (as</p></div><div class="section"><p>determined by the Company) equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount that would, absent reimbursement, be</p></div><div class="section"><p>reportable with respect to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in the Summary Compensation Table (which</p></div><div class="section"><p>we refer to as the SEC Cost), or (ii) the expenses of operating such flight that may be charged pursuant to</p></div><div class="section"><p>Federal Aviation Regulation Section 91.501(d) as in effect from time to time (which we refer to as the FAR</p></div><div class="section"><p>Expenses).

The grant date for annual awards to all employees has been established as</p></div><div class="section"><p>November 19 of each year.</p></div><div class="section"><p>In addition to the annual grants, stock awards may be granted at other times during the year to new hires,</p></div><div class="section"><p>employees receiving promotions, and in other special circumstances. The Equity Grant Policy provides that only</p></div><div class="section"><p>the Compensation Committee may make such “off-cycle” grants to NEOs, other members of Visa’s Executive</p></div><div class="section"><p>Committee, and Section 16 officers. The Compensation Committee has delegated the authority to the Stock</p></div><div class="section"><p>Committee to make off-cycle grants to other employees, subject to guidelines established by the Compensation</p></div><div class="section"><p>Committee. Any off-cycle awards approved by the Stock Committee or the Compensation Committee are granted</p></div><div class="section"><p>on the 15th day of the calendar month or on such other date determined by the Stock Committee, Compensation</p></div><div class="section"><p>Committee, or the Board.</p></div><div class="section"><p>For all newly granted stock option awards, the exercise price will be the closing price of our Class A common</p></div><div class="section"><p>stock on the NYSE on the date of the grant. If the grant date falls on a non-trading day, the exercise price of stock</p></div><div class="section"><p>option awards will be the closing price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE on the last trading day</p></div><div class="section"><p>preceding the date of grant.</p></div></div><h5>Stock Ownership Guidelines</h5><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>The Compensation Committee maintains stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs as follows:</p></div><h6>Officer Stock Ownership Guidelines</h6><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Alfred F.

Newly hired or</p></div><div class="section"><p>promoted executives have five years from the date of the commencement of their appointment to attain these</p></div><div class="section"><p>ownership levels. Each NEO currently meets or exceeds the applicable guideline set forth in the table above. If an</p></div><div class="section"><p>executive officer does not meet the applicable guideline by the end of the five-year period, the executive officer is</p></div><div class="section"><p>required to hold a minimum of 50% of the net shares resulting from any future vesting of restricted stock,</p></div><div class="section"><p>restricted stock units, performance shares, or exercise of stock options until the guideline is met. These guidelines</p></div><div class="section"><p>reinforce the importance of aligning the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stakeholders</p></div><div class="section"><p>and encourage our executive officers to consider the long-term perspective when managing the Company.</p></div></div></div><h5>Hedging and Pledging Prohibition</h5><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>As part of our insider trading policy, all employees, including our NEOs, and non-employee directors are</p></div><div class="section"><p>prohibited from engaging in short sales of our securities, establishing margin accounts related to our securities,</p></div><div class="section"><p>pledging our securities as collateral for a loan, buying or selling puts or calls on our securities, or otherwise</p></div><div class="section"><p>engaging in hedging transactions (such as zero-cost collars, exchange funds, and forward sale contracts)</p></div><div class="section"><p>involving our securities.</p></div></div></div><h4>Recoupment Policies</h4><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>We have a Clawback Policy pursuant to which NEOs and other executive officers may be required to reimburse</p></div><div class="section"><p>or forfeit incentive compensation paid to them if the financial results upon which the awards were based are</p></div><div class="section"><p>materially restated due to fraud, intentional misconduct, or gross negligence of the executive officer.</p></div><div class="section"><p>The Clawback Policy permits the Board to determine if it will seek to recover applicable compensation, taking into</p></div><div class="section"><p>account the following considerations as it deems appropriate:</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Whether the amount of any bonus or equity compensation paid or awarded during the covered time</p></div><div class="section"><p>period, based on the achievement of specific performance targets, would have been reduced based on</p></div><div class="section"><p>the restated financial results;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• The likelihood of success of recouping the compensation under governing law relative to the effort</p></div><div class="section"><p>involved;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Whether the recoupment may prejudice Visa’s interest in any related proceeding or investigation;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Whether the expense required to recoup the compensation is likely to exceed the amount to be</p></div><div class="section"><p>recovered;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• The passage of time since the occurrence of the misconduct;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Any pending legal action related to the misconduct;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• The tax consequences to the affected individual; and</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Any other factors the Board may deem appropriate under the circumstances.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Under the Clawback Policy, we can require reimbursement or forfeiture of all or a portion of any bonus, incentive</p></div><div class="section"><p>payment, equity-based award (including performance shares, restricted stock or restricted stock units, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>outstanding stock options) or other compensation to the fullest extent permitted by law. Reimbursement or</p></div><div class="section"><p>forfeiture may include compensation paid or awarded during the period covered by the restatement and applies to</p></div><div class="section"><p>compensation awarded in periods occurring after the adoption of the Clawback Policy.</p></div><div class="section"><p>66</p></div><div class="section"><p>We believe our Clawback Policy is sufficiently broad to reduce the potential risk that an executive officer would</p></div><div class="section"><p>intentionally misstate results to benefit under an incentive program and provides a right of recovery if an executive</p></div><div class="section"><p>officer took actions that, in hindsight, should not have been rewarded. In addition, appropriate language regarding</p></div><div class="section"><p>the policy has been included in applicable documents and award agreements and our executive officers are</p></div><div class="section"><p>required to acknowledge in writing that compensation we have awarded to them may be subject to</p></div><div class="section"><p>reimbursement, clawback, or forfeiture pursuant to the terms of the policy and/or applicable law. Further, the</p></div><div class="section"><p>equity forfeiture provisions in applicable award agreements would also apply in the event of specified detrimental</p></div><div class="section"><p>activity in the absence of a restatement.</p></div></div><h4>Tax Implications – Deductibility of Executive Compensation</h4><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, limits our ability to deduct for tax purposes</p></div><div class="section"><p>compensation in excess of $1 million paid to certain executive officers.

National Legal and Policy Center has submitted documentation</p></div><div class="section"><p>indicating that it is the beneficial owner of at least 106 shares of our Class A common stock and has advised Visa</p></div><div class="section"><p>that it intends to continue to hold the requisite amount of shares through the date of the Annual Meeting. National</p></div><div class="section"><p>Legal and Policy Center’s proposal and its related supporting statement are followed by a recommendation from</p></div><div class="section"><p>the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors disclaims any responsibility for the content of the proposal and the</p></div><div class="section"><p>statement in support of the proposal, which are presented in the form received from the stockholder.</p></div><h4>Request for Board of Directors to Adopt Policy for an Independent Chair</h4><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>RESOLVED:</p></div><div class="section"><p>Shareholders request the Board of Directors adopt as policy, and amend the bylaws as necessary, to require</p></div><div class="section"><p>hereafter that the Chair of the Board of Directors be an independent member of the Board, consistent with</p></div><div class="section"><p>applicable law and existing contracts. If the Board determines that a Chair who was independent when selected is</p></div><div class="section"><p>no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chair who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a</p></div><div class="section"><p>reasonable amount of time.</p></div><div class="section"><p>SUPPORTING STATEMENT:</p></div><div class="section"><p>The Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. is also Board Chairman. We believe these roles – each with separate,</p></div><div class="section"><p>different responsibilities that are critical to the health of a successful corporation – are greatly diminished when</p></div><div class="section"><p>held by a singular company official, thus weakening its governance structure.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Expert perspectives substantiate our position:</p></div><div class="section"><p>• According to the Council of Institutional Investors (https://bit.ly/3pKrtJK), “A CEO who also serves as</p></div><div class="section"><p>chair can exert excessive influence on the board and its agenda, weakening the board’s oversight of</p></div><div class="section"><p>management. Separating the chair and CEO positions reduces this conflict, and an independent chair</p></div><div class="section"><p>provides the clearest separation of power between the CEO and the rest of the board.”</p></div><div class="section"><p>• A 2014 report from Deloitte (https://bit.ly/3vQGqe1) concluded, “The chairman should lead the board and</p></div><div class="section"><p>there should be a clear division of responsibilities between the chairman and the chief executive officer</p></div><div class="section"><p>(CEO).”</p></div><div class="section"><p>• A pair of business law professors wrote for Harvard Business Review (https://bit.ly/3xvcIOA) in March</p></div><div class="section"><p>2020 that “letting the CEO chair the board can compromise board discussion quality, weakening the</p></div><div class="section"><p>corporation’s risk management ability... Splitting the CEO and board chair jobs between two people can</p></div><div class="section"><p>help strengthen the quality of questions the corporation asks itself. When those questions remain weak,</p></div><div class="section"><p>the organization is less likely to develop strategies that mitigate risk.”</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Proxy adviser Glass Lewis advised (https://bit.ly/3xwuJwa) in 2021, “the presence of an independent</p></div><div class="section"><p>chair fosters the creation of a thoughtful and dynamic board not dominated by the views of senior</p></div><div class="section"><p>management. Further, we believe that the separation of these two key roles eliminates the conflict of</p></div><div class="section"><p>interest that inevitably occurs when a CEO is responsible for self-oversight.”</p></div><div class="section"><p>90</p></div></div><h4>Statement of the Board of Directors in Opposition to Proposal 5</h4><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST this proposal, for the following reasons:</p></div><div class="section"><p>• We believe flexibility in Board leadership structure is more suitable for the Company than the rigid and</p></div><div class="section"><p>prescriptive approach set forth in the Stockholder Proposal.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• We believe Visa’s current Board leadership structure, which includes a strong Lead Independent</p></div><div class="section"><p>Director, best serves the Company and our stockholders.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Visa’s strong corporate governance practices provide effective, independent Board oversight.</p></div><h5>We believe flexibility in Board leadership structure is more suitable for the Company than the rigid and</h5><div class="section"></div><h5>prescriptive approach set forth in the Stockholder Proposal. </h5><div class="section"><div class="section"></div><div class="section"><p>evaluate and determine the most appropriate Board leadership structure for the Company and our stockholders in</p></div><div class="section"><p>light of the needs of the Board and the Company at any given time.

We believe that the Company and our</p></div><div class="section"><p>stockholders benefit from this flexibility, and that the Board is best positioned to make this determination given our</p></div><div class="section"><p>directors’ knowledge of the Company’s leadership team, strategic goals, opportunities, and challenges. We</p></div><div class="section"><p>believe that it is in the best interests of Visa and our stockholders for the Board to continue to determine the most</p></div><div class="section"><p>effective leadership structure for Visa on a case-by-case basis, rather than take a rigid approach to Board</p></div><div class="section"><p>leadership, as requested by the stockholder proposal.</p></div></div><h5>We believe Visa’s Board leadership structure, which includes a strong Lead Independent Director, best</h5><div class="section"></div><h5>serves the Company and our stockholders. </h5><div class="section"><div class="section"></div><div class="section"><p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, with John Lundgren serving as Lead Independent Director. Overall,</p></div><div class="section"><p>directors view the Board and Committees as effective and feel the Board leadership structure works well for the</p></div><div class="section"><p>Company. As discussed in more detail under Corporate Governance – Board Leadership Structure, the Board</p></div><div class="section"><p>believes that at this time, this current structure is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders as</p></div><div class="section"><p>this structure allows Mr. Kelly to effectively manage the business, execute on our strategic priorities, and lead the</p></div><div class="section"><p>Board, while empowering Mr. Lundgren to provide independent Board leadership and oversight with the robust,</p></div><div class="section"><p>well-defined leadership powers and responsibilities described below. The Board believes that Mr. Kelly’s inclusive</p></div><div class="section"><p>leadership style and decades of payments expertise make him uniquely qualified to lead discussions of the Board;</p></div><div class="section"><p>foster an important unity of leadership between the Board and management; and promote alignment of the</p></div><div class="section"><p>Company’s strategy with its operational execution.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our Lead Independent Director, elected by the independent directors of the Board, has specifically enumerated</p></div><div class="section"><p>powers and responsibilities, providing what the Board believes are the same leadership, oversight, and benefits to</p></div><div class="section"><p>the Company and Board that would be provided by an independent chairman. These powers and responsibilities</p></div><div class="section"><p>include:</p></div><div class="section"><p>• calling, setting the agenda for, and chairing periodic executive sessions and meetings of the independent</p></div><div class="section"><p>directors;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• chairing Board meetings in the absence of the Chairperson of the Board or when it is deemed</p></div><div class="section"><p>appropriate arising from the Chairperson’s management role or non-independence;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• providing feedback to the Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer on corporate and Board policies and</p></div><div class="section"><p>strategies and acting as a liaison between the Board and the Chief Executive Officer;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• facilitating communication among directors and between the Board and management;</p></div><div class="section"><p>91</p></div><div class="section"><p>• in concert with the Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer, advising on the agenda, schedule, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>materials for Board meetings and strategic planning sessions based on input from directors;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• coordinating with the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and leading the</p></div><div class="section"><p>independent directors’ involvement in Chief Executive Officer succession planning, selection of</p></div><div class="section"><p>committee chairs and committee membership, and the Board evaluation process;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• coordinating with the Chair of the Compensation Committee and leading the independent directors’</p></div><div class="section"><p>evaluation of Chief Executive Officer performance and compensation;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• communicating with stockholders as necessary; and</p></div><div class="section"><p>• carrying out such other duties as are requested by the independent directors, the Board, or any of its</p></div><div class="section"><p>committees from time to time.</p></div><div class="section"><p>In addition to our Lead Independent Director, independent directors chair the Board’s four standing committees,</p></div><div class="section"><p>and each has responsibilities that contribute to the Board’s oversight of management, as well as facilitate</p></div><div class="section"><p>communication among the Board and management.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our Board recognizes that circumstances may change such that a different structure may be warranted to support</p></div><div class="section"><p>the Company’s needs.

In connection with Chief Executive</p></div><div class="section"><p>Officer transitions in the past decade, the Board determined that it was appropriate to separate the roles of the</p></div><div class="section"><p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and to appoint an independent Chairman. Yet, more recently, in 2019, after</p></div><div class="section"><p>discussing the relative benefits of combining the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles versus retaining the</p></div><div class="section"><p>separate roles with an independent Chairman and considering the perspectives of our independent directors,</p></div><div class="section"><p>views of our stockholders, peer companies’ practices, and recent governance trends, the Board unanimously</p></div><div class="section"><p>elected Mr. Kelly as Chairman. The independent directors then reaffirmed the Board’s commitment to</p></div><div class="section"><p>independent board leadership by unanimously electing Mr. Lundgren as Lead Independent Director. In connection</p></div><div class="section"><p>with the CEO transition announced on November 17, 2022, the Board determined to separate the roles of</p></div><div class="section"><p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer effective February 1, 2023 and have Mr. Kelly serve as Executive</p></div><div class="section"><p>Chairman to help ensure a successful and seamless transition.</p></div></div><h5>Visa’s strong corporate governance practices provide effective, independent Board oversight. </h5><div class="section"><div class="section"></div><div class="section"><p>with our commitment to foster and maintain responsible corporate governance, Visa has adopted practices and</p></div><div class="section"><p>procedures that promote Board independence and effective oversight of management and provide stockholders</p></div><div class="section"><p>with meaningful rights, including:</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Annual Board Elections – The Board is elected annually with a majority voting standard in uncontested</p></div><div class="section"><p>director elections;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Stockholder Rights – Our stockholders have the right to call special meetings and our stockholders</p></div><div class="section"><p>have a market-standard proxy access right;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Majority Independent Board – Nine out of ten of our Board nominees are independent; Mr. Kelly, our</p></div><div class="section"><p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the only director nominee who is not independent;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Active and Experienced Board – Our directors are highly-qualified and engaged with the relevant</p></div><div class="section"><p>business experience and skills to oversee management;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Board Oversight of Environmental, Social, and Governance – Our Nominating and Corporate</p></div><div class="section"><p>Governance Committee has formal responsibility for and oversight of Visa’s ESG policies, programs, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>reporting in their totality, as well as for the individual topics of environmental sustainability, climate</p></div><div class="section"><p>change, human rights, political activities and expenditures, and social impact and philanthropy;</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Director Succession Planning and Board Refreshment – Our Nominating and Corporate Governance</p></div><div class="section"><p>Committee regularly oversees and plans for director succession and refreshment of the Board to cultivate a</p></div><div class="section"><p>mix of skills, experience, tenure, and diversity that promotes and supports the Company’s long-term strategy;</p></div><div class="section"><p>92</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Proactive and Ongoing Stockholder Engagement Program – We have proactive, ongoing</p></div><div class="section"><p>engagement with our stockholders throughout the year focused on corporate governance, corporate</p></div><div class="section"><p>responsibility, and executive compensation.

To nominate a candidate or submit a proposal for</p></div><div class="section"><p>consideration at our 2024 annual meeting pursuant to our advance notice bylaw provisions, stockholders must</p></div><div class="section"><p>deliver or mail their nomination submission or other stockholder notice of a proposal so that it is received by our</p></div><div class="section"><p>Corporate Secretary no earlier than 120 days and no later than 90 days prior to the date of the annual meeting.</p></div><div class="section"><p>However, if we provide stockholders less than 100 days’ notice or other prior public disclosure of the date of our</p></div><div class="section"><p>2024 annual meeting, we must receive any stockholder nomination or proposal no later than the close of business</p></div><div class="section"><p>on the 10th day following the earlier of the day on which we mailed or otherwise publicly disclosed notice of the</p></div><div class="section"><p>meeting date. In addition to satisfying the deadlines in the advance notice provisions of our Bylaws, a stockholder</p></div><div class="section"><p>who intends to solicit proxies in support of nominees submitted under these advance notice provisions must</p></div><div class="section"><p>provide the notice required under Rule 14a-19 to the Corporate Secretary no later than November 25, 2023.</p></div><div class="section"><p>In addition, the Company’s Bylaws permit up to 20 stockholders owning 3% or more of our Class A common stock</p></div><div class="section"><p>for a period of at least three years to nominate up to 20% of the Board and include these nominees in our proxy</p></div><div class="section"><p>materials, subject to certain provisions included in our Bylaws.

This method of delivery, known as “householding,” permits us</p></div><div class="section"><p>to realize significant cost savings, reduces the amount of duplicate information stockholders receive, and reduces</p></div><div class="section"><p>the environmental impact of printing and mailing documents to our stockholders. Under this process, certain</p></div><div class="section"><p>99</p></div><div class="section"><p>stockholders will receive only one copy of our proxy materials and any additional proxy materials that are</p></div><div class="section"><p>delivered until such time as one or more of these stockholders notifies us that they want to receive separate</p></div><div class="section"><p>copies. Any stockholders who object to or wish to begin householding may contact our Investor Relations</p></div><div class="section"><p>Department at (650) 432-7644, InvestorRelations@visa.com or Investor Relations, Visa Inc., P.O. Box 8999, San</p></div><div class="section"><p>Francisco, CA 94128-8999. We will send an individual copy of the proxy statement to any stockholder who</p></div><div class="section"><p>revokes their consent to householding within 30 days of our receipt of such revocation.</p></div></div><h4>Fiscal Year 2022 Annual Report and SEC Filings</h4><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Our financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 are included in our Annual Report on Form</p></div><div class="section"><p>10-K.
