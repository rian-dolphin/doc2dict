We are excited by what Microsoft’s advancements in a defining technology of our </p></div><div class="section"><p>time, artificial intelligence (“AI”), can and will do for people, industry, and society and the central role AI will play in the </p></div><div class="section"><p>Company’s mission to help every person and organization on the planet to achieve more. We also recognize the </p></div><div class="section"><p>responsibility to ensure this world-changing technology is used responsibly. Microsoft’s work on AI is guided by a core set </p></div><div class="section"><p>of principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Amidst global business challenges, Microsoft revenues once again broke records in fiscal year  2023. Microsoft’s leadership </p></div><div class="section"><p>and the Company as a whole achieved this through relentless focus on providing technology innovations to make our </p></div><div class="section"><p>customers more productive and resilient. As a result, Microsoft delivered strong results for its shareholders, including a </p></div><div class="section"><p>return of over $38 billion in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We look forward to more opportunity ahead as </p></div><div class="section"><p>we remain committed to the long-term interests of the Company’s shareholders and a broad range of stakeholders critical </p></div><div class="section"><p>to the Company’s success, including employees, customers, the communities we operate in, and our partners and suppliers. </p></div><div class="section"><p>With this in mind, Microsoft continued to provide transparency in its progress towards important environmental and social </p></div><div class="section"><p>commitments, including our climate goals, our progress towards advancing diversity and inclusion across our workforce, and </p></div><div class="section"><p>the Racial Equity Initiative goals we are committed to meet by 2025. For more information on these initiatives and information </p></div><div class="section"><p>across a breadth of environmental, social, and governance topics, we encourage you to read the progress reports Microsoft </p></div><div class="section"><p>published over the course of the past fiscal year which are available at microsoft.com/transparency and microsoft.com/csr. </p></div><div class="section"><p>This Proxy Statement describes Microsoft’s corporate governance policies and practices that foster the Board’s effective </p></div><div class="section"><p>oversight of the Company’s business strategies and practices. A key component to our effective governance is the Board’s </p></div><div class="section"><p>commitment to provide oversight and perspectives reflecting a diversity of independent views. </p></div><div class="section"><p>This year’s Board nominees represent a wide range of backgrounds and expertise. We believe our diversity of experiences, </p></div><div class="section"><p>perspectives, and skills contributes to the Board’s effectiveness in managing risk and providing guidance that positions </p></div><div class="section"><p>Microsoft for long-term success in a dynamically changing business environment. Of the 12 Board nominees, 11 are </p></div><div class="section"><p>independent, which includes Sandra Peterson as Lead Independent Director and all committee chairs and members. We </p></div><div class="section"><p>are pleased to announce the nominations of Catherine MacGregor and Mark Mason for election to the Board at our </p></div><div class="section"><p>December 7, 2023 Annual Meeting. Ms. MacGregor is Group CEO of Engie S.A. (“Engie”) and a member of the Engie board. </p></div><div class="section"><p>She is an accomplished leader in the energy business and will bring significant insights and global experience to Microsoft. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Mr. Mason is CFO of Citigroup Inc. He brings strategic and operational experience and a deep understanding of how </p></div><div class="section"><p>commerce is changing globally. </p></div><div class="section"><p>In addition, two members of the Board have decided not to seek re-election and will end their Board service in December: </p></div><div class="section"><p>Padmasree Warrior and John Thompson. Ms. Warrior served on the Board and on the Compensation Committee for nearly </p></div><div class="section"><p>eight years and has contributed valuable insights and perspectives in those roles. During his eleven-year tenure, </p></div><div class="section"><p>Mr. Thompson served as both Board Chair and Lead Independent Director, led the CEO search and succession process </p></div><div class="section"><p>from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella, and chaired the Governance and Nominating Committee during a fruitful period of </p></div><div class="section"><p>Board refreshment and diversification.

As noted above, the Board updates our corporate governance </p></div><div class="section"><p>framework each summer based on a number of inputs, including shareholder feedback. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Our Office of the Corporate Secretary coordinates shareholder engagement with Investor Relations and provides a summary of all </p></div><div class="section"><p>relevant feedback to our Board. In fiscal year 2023, members of our Board and management engaged with a cross-section of </p></div><div class="section"><p>shareholders owning approximately 50% of Microsoft shares. In addition, throughout the year our Investor Relations group </p></div><div class="section"><p>engages with our shareholders, frequently along with Satya Nadella, our Chairman and CEO, and Amy Hood, our CFO. </p></div><div class="section"><p>To communicate broadly with our shareholders, we also seek to transparently share relevant information through our Investor </p></div><div class="section"><p>Relations website, our Annual Report, this Proxy Statement, our Reports Hub, and in posts on the Microsoft On the Issues blog. </p></div></div><h1>Board Leadership </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>The Board’s independent directors elected Satya Nadella to the role of Chairman and CEO. In March 2023, the independent </p></div><div class="section"><p>directors elected Sandra Peterson as Lead Independent Director. She succeeds John Thompson, who had served in the roles of Lead</p></div><div class="section"><p>Independent Director or Board Chair since 2012. </p></div><div class="section"><p>In his role, Mr. Nadella leverages his deep understanding of the business to elevate the right strategic opportunities and identify </p></div><div class="section"><p>key risks and mitigation approaches for the Board’s review. As Lead Independent Director, Ms. Peterson retains significant authority </p></div><div class="section"><p>including providing input on behalf of the independent directors on Board agendas and schedules, calling meetings of the </p></div><div class="section"><p>independent directors, authorizing retention of outside counsel, advisors, or other consultants, setting agendas for executive </p></div><div class="section"><p>sessions, leading performance evaluations of the CEO, and overseeing CEO succession planning. Additional information about the </p></div><div class="section"><p>role of the Lead Independent Director is described in this Part 1 under “Board Independence” below. </p></div><div class="section"><p>The Board does not have a policy as to whether the Chairman should be an independent director, an affiliated director, or a </p></div><div class="section"><p>member of management. The independent directors annually appoint a Chairman of the Board. To ensure robust independent </p></div><div class="section"><p>leadership on the Board, if the individual appointed as Chairman is not an independent director, or when the independent directors </p></div><div class="section"><p>determine that it is in the best interests of the Company, the independent directors will also annually appoint a Lead Independent </p></div><div class="section"><p>Director. Our Board believes its current leadership structure is appropriate because it effectively allocates authority, responsibility, </p></div><div class="section"><p>and oversight between management and the independent members of our Board. It does this by giving primary responsibility for </p></div><div class="section"><p>the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, while enabling the </p></div><div class="section"><p>Lead Independent Director to facilitate our Board’s independent oversight of management, promote communication between </p></div><div class="section"><p>management and our Board, and support our Board’s consideration of key governance matters. The Board believes its programs for </p></div><div class="section"><p>overseeing risk, as described in this Part 1 under “Risk Oversight,” would be effective under a variety of leadership frameworks and </p></div><div class="section"><p>therefore do not materially affect its choice of structure. </p></div><div class="section"><p class="textsmall">12 </p></div><div class="section"><p></p></div><div class="section"><p></p></div><div class="section"><p></p></div><div class="section"><p></p></div><div class="section"><p>1 GOVERNANCE AND </p></div><div class="section"><p>OUR BOARD OF </p></div><div class="section"><p>DIRECTORS 2 NAMED </p></div><div class="section"><p>EXECUTIVE OFFICER </p></div><div class="section"><p>COMPENSATION 3 AUDIT </p></div><div class="section"><p>COMMITTEE </p></div><div class="section"><p>MATTERS 4 PROPOSALS TO </p></div><div class="section"><p>BE VOTED ON DURING </p></div><div class="section"><p>THE MEETING 5 INFORMATION </p></div><div class="section"><p>ABOUT THE </p></div><div class="section"><p>MEETING </p></div><div class="section"><p></p></div></div><h1>CEO Succession </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>A primary responsibility of the Board is planning for CEO succession and overseeing identification and development of other </p></div><div class="section"><p>members of the senior leadership team (“SLT”). The Board and the Compensation Committee work with the CEO and our Chief </p></div><div class="section"><p>Human Resources Officer to plan for succession. For the CEO, the succession plan covers identification of internal and external</p></div><div class="section"><p>candidates, and professional and leadership development plans for internal candidates. The Board annually reviews the CEO </p></div><div class="section"><p>succession plan. The criteria used to assess potential CEO candidates are formulated based on the Company’s business strategies, </p></div><div class="section"><p>and include strategic vision, leadership, and operational execution. The Board is committed to actively seeking highly qualified </p></div><div class="section"><p>women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool of potential CEO candidates. The Board maintains an </p></div><div class="section"><p>emergency succession contingency plan that is reviewed on an annual basis by the Board and Governance and Nominating </p></div><div class="section"><p>Committee. The plan identifies roles and responsibilities of individuals who would act if an unforeseen event prevented the CEO</p></div><div class="section"><p>from continuing to serve. The Compensation Committee reviews with the CEO and reports to the Board on development and </p></div><div class="section"><p>succession plans for the other members of the SLT. The Board may review development and succession planning more frequently </p></div><div class="section"><p>as it deems necessary or desirable. </p></div></div><h1>Annual Board and Committee Evaluation Process </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>The Board is committed to a rigorous self-evaluation process. The Governance and Nominating Committee annually evaluates the </p></div><div class="section"><p>performance of the Board. In fiscal year 2023, the evaluation included utilizing a third-party facilitator to seek feedback from each </p></div><div class="section"><p>director on the performance of the Board and each committee. The results were reported to and discussed with the Board and each</p></div><div class="section"><p>relevant committee. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Our evaluation process is designed to elicit feedback on the processes, structure, composition, and effectiveness of the Board and </p></div><div class="section"><p>each committee. The evaluation results have facilitated increased Board and committee effectiveness, including driving clarity on </p></div><div class="section"><p>key areas for the Board’s focus over the coming year, focus on sustainable growth strategies for the Company, and input on </p></div><div class="section"><p>management development and succession planning as well as Board and committee composition and recruiting. </p></div></div><h1>Director Attendance </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Each quarter, our Board holds two-day meetings comprised of committee and Board meetings.

Our Board met nine times during fiscal year 2023. In addition, the Board held periodic meetings </p></div><div class="section"><p>dedicated to strategy topics which included presentations and discussions with members of our SLT and other senior management. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Each director nominee attended at least 75% of the aggregate of all fiscal year 2023 meetings of the Board and each committee on </p></div><div class="section"><p>which he or she served. In fiscal year 2023, the Board and committees of the Board held a total of 35 meetings. Together, the </p></div><div class="section"><p>director nominees attended at least 95% of the combined total meetings of the Board and the committees on which they were </p></div><div class="section"><p>members in fiscal year 2023. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Directors are expected to attend the annual shareholders meeting, if practicable. All directors attended the 2022 Annual Meeting. </p></div></div><h1>Director Orientation and Continuing Education </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Our orientation programs are designed to familiarize new directors with our businesses, strategies, and policies and assist new</p></div><div class="section"><p>directors in developing Company and industry knowledge to optimize their service on the Board. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Regular continuing education programs enhance the skills and knowledge directors use to perform their responsibilities. These </p></div><div class="section"><p>programs may include internally developed programs or programs presented by third parties. </p></div></div><h1>Director Stock Ownership Policy </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>To align the interests of our directors and shareholders, our directors are required to own Microsoft shares equal in value to at least </p></div><div class="section"><p>three times the base annual retainer (cash and stock) payable to a director. Each director must retain 50% of all net shares </p></div><div class="section"><p>(post-tax) from the retainer until reaching the minimum share ownership requirement. Stock deferred under the Deferred </p></div><div class="section"><p>Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors counts toward the minimum ownership requirement.

The Corporate </p></div><div class="section"><p>Governance Guidelines provide that a substantial majority of our directors will be independent.

Key elements </p></div><div class="section"><p>of our Board independence include: </p></div><div class="section"><p>• 11 of 12 director nominees are independent. We are committed to maintaining a substantial majority of directors who are </p></div><div class="section"><p>independent of the Company and management. Except for our Chairman and CEO, Satya Nadella, all director nominees are </p></div><div class="section"><p>independent </p></div><div class="section"><p>• Board tenure. We are committed to board refreshment. To strike a balance between retaining directors with deep knowledge of </p></div><div class="section"><p>the Company and adding directors with a fresh perspective, the Board seeks to maintain an average tenure of 10 years or less for </p></div><div class="section"><p>its independent directors as a group. The average tenure for our independent director nominees is 5.4 years. The average tenure</p></div><div class="section"><p>is 5.7 years if Mr. Nadella is included </p></div><div class="section"><p>• Board diversity. The Board is committed to actively seeking highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups to </p></div><div class="section"><p>include in the pool of potential Board nominees and CEO candidates </p></div><div class="section"><p>• Executive sessions of independent directors.

In making its annual director nominations determination, the Board’s objective </p></div><div class="section"><p>is to recommend a group of directors that can best ensure the continuing success of our business and represent shareholder </p></div><div class="section"><p>interests through the exercise of sound judgment using its diversity of experience and perspectives. </p></div><div class="section"><p>The Governance and Nominating Committee recommends to the Board director candidates for nomination and election during the </p></div><div class="section"><p>annual shareholders meeting or for appointment to fill vacancies. The Committee works with our Board to determine the </p></div><div class="section"><p>characteristics, skills, and experience for the Board as a whole and its individual members with the objective of having a board with </p></div><div class="section"><p>diverse backgrounds, skills, and experience. In making its recommendations to our Board, the Committee considers the </p></div><div class="section"><p>qualifications of individual director candidates applying the Board membership criteria described below. The Committee retains any </p></div><div class="section"><p>search firm involved in identifying potential candidates and approves their fees. </p></div><div class="section"><p>For all directors, we require an independent mindset, integrity, personal and professional ethics, business judgment, and the ability </p></div><div class="section"><p>and willingness to commit sufficient time to the Board. Our Board considers many factors in evaluating the suitability of individual </p></div><div class="section"><p>director candidates, including their general understanding of global business, sales and marketing, finance, and other disciplines </p></div><div class="section"><p>relevant to the success of a large, publicly traded company; understanding of our business and technology; educational and </p></div><div class="section"><p>professional background; personal accomplishment; and national, gender, age, and ethnic diversity. </p></div><div class="section"><p>This Proxy Statement includes a table summarizing the key qualifications, skills, and attributes currently most relevant to the</p></div><div class="section"><p>decision to nominate candidates to serve on the Board. As the Board strives to maintain a diverse set of skills and attributes,  it also </p></div><div class="section"><p>expects that each member will be able to understand and contribute meaningfully to the oversight of the range of material </p></div><div class="section"><p>business, risk, and regulatory issues the Company faces. Management’s responsibility includes educating and communicating to the </p></div><div class="section"><p>Board in a way that enables effective oversight of this broad set of issues. The Board is committed to actively seeking highly </p></div><div class="section"><p>qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which new candidates are selected. We work </p></div><div class="section"><p>with our search firm to ensure the candidate slate provided to the Committee includes diverse candidates. </p></div><div class="section"><p>The Board does not believe that directors should expect to be re-nominated annually. In determining whether to recommend a </p></div><div class="section"><p>director for re-election, the Committee considers the director’s participation in and contributions to the activities of the Board, the </p></div><div class="section"><p>results of the most recent Board evaluation, and meeting attendance. </p></div><div class="section"><p>When the Committee recruits new director candidates, that process typically involves either a search firm or a member of the Committee </p></div><div class="section"><p>contacting a prospect to assess interest and availability. A candidate will then meet with members of the Board and Mr. Nadella, and </p></div><div class="section"><p>then meet with members of management as appropriate. At the same time, the Committee and the search firm will contact references </p></div><div class="section"><p>for the candidate. A background check is completed before  a final candidate recommendation is made to the Board. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Shareholders have previously elected all Board nominees, except Ms. MacGregor and Mr. Mason.

Management provides the Governance and Nominating </p></div><div class="section"><p>Committee and Board with relevant known facts and circumstances of any relationship bearing on the independence of a director </p></div><div class="section"><p>or nominee that is outside the categories permitted under the director independence guidelines. The Committee then completes </p></div><div class="section"><p>an assessment of each director considering all known relevant facts and circumstances concerning any relationship bearing on the </p></div><div class="section"><p>independence of a director or nominee. This process includes evaluating whether any identified relationship otherwise adversely</p></div><div class="section"><p>affects a director’s independence and affirmatively determining that the director has no material relationship with Microsoft, </p></div><div class="section"><p>another director, or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with our Company. </p></div><div class="section"><p>The Governance and Nominating Committee also considers the tenure of a director, and for longer serving directors, whether the </p></div><div class="section"><p>duration of service impacts the director’s independence from management, as demonstrated by the director’s relationship with </p></div><div class="section"><p>management and the director’s participation in Board and committee deliberations. The Board seeks to maintain an average tenure</p></div><div class="section"><p>of 10 years or less for its independent directors as a group. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Based on the review and recommendation by the Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board analyzed the independence </p></div><div class="section"><p>of each director and nominee. The Board determined that Mses. List, MacGregor, Peterson, Pritzker, Walmsley, and Warrior, and </p></div><div class="section"><p>Messrs. Hoffman, Johnston, Mason, Rodriguez, Scharf, Stanton, and Thompson meet the standards of independence under our </p></div><div class="section"><p>Corporate Governance Guidelines, the director independence guidelines, and applicable Nasdaq listing standards, including that </p></div><div class="section"><p>each member is free of any relationship that would interfere with his or her individual exercise of independent judgment. In making </p></div><div class="section"><p>its independence determination, the Committee and Board considered ordinary course transactions between Microsoft and certain </p></div><div class="section"><p>related entities, for instance the purchase of software licenses by companies of which a director is an executive officer, and </p></div><div class="section"><p>purchases by Microsoft of goods and services from such companies. </p></div></div><h1>Certain Relationships and Related Transactions </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>We are a global company with extensive operations in the U.S. and many foreign countries.

We are committed to continually reviewing our compensation program to </p></div><div class="section"><p>ensure it is grounded in our pay-for-performance philosophy. </p></div><div class="section"><p>At the beginning of fiscal 2023, we faced a changing global macroeconomic environment, including increasing inflation and rising </p></div><div class="section"><p>interest rates, resulting in financial headwinds which created challenges in goal setting for our executive compensation program. </p></div><div class="section"><p>We nonetheless continued to set rigorous performance goals that included meaningful year-over-year growth across our </p></div><div class="section"><p>performance metrics and focused on long-term alignment of executive compensation with shareholder interests. As a result, for </p></div><div class="section"><p>fiscal year 2023, the financial metric-based portion of our annual cash incentives achieved 63.61% of target, and the PSA program </p></div><div class="section"><p>core metrics achieved 99.65% of target. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Our Company continued with its active shareholder outreach program during fiscal year 2023, engaging investors representing </p></div><div class="section"><p>approximately 50% of our shares outstanding.

During fiscal year 2023, we continued to address shareholders’ desire to ensure the </p></div><div class="section"><p>ongoing retention and motivation of Mr. Nadella, and the independent members of the Board continue to have high confidence in </p></div><div class="section"><p>Mr. Nadella’s exceptional leadership of Microsoft. The Board continues its support of a compensation structure that delivers 100% </p></div><div class="section"><p>of Mr. Nadella’s equity compensation via performance stock awards. Under this program, over 95% of Mr. Nadella’s annual target </p></div><div class="section"><p>compensation opportunity is performance-based. Again, for fiscal year 2023, we set Mr. Nadella’s target performance stock award</p></div><div class="section"><p>at $50,000,000, which we believe is the appropriate level of equity compensation for a leader with his extraordinary capabilities and </p></div><div class="section"><p>responsibilities and for a company of Microsoft’s extraordinary scale and complexity. </p></div><div class="section"><p>We also continue to look carefully at emerging investor expectations and best practices for addressing environmental, social, and </p></div><div class="section"><p>governance (“ESG”) commitments in our executive compensation program. We have been early leaders in this practice, having </p></div><div class="section"><p>included an assessment of CEO and Senior Leadership Team (“SLT”) progress on culture and diversity and inclusion since 2016 as </p></div><div class="section"><p>part of the operational assessment component of the annual cash incentive under our Executive Incentive Plan.

Officer in its history, Microsoft had </p></div><div class="section"><p>revenues of $86.8 billion, net income of $22.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $2.63. Those figures have, respectively, more </p></div><div class="section"><p>than doubled ($211.9 billion), more than tripled ($72.4 billion), and nearly quadrupled ($9.68) in the intervening years. In addition to </p></div><div class="section"><p>another year of consistently strong financial performance, Mr. Nadella and his leadership team have positioned Microsoft to </p></div><div class="section"><p>continue to drive performance for years to come. As discussed in more detail below, they have achieved this through: </p></div><div class="section"><p>• Growing and diversifying the business through leading-edge innovation </p></div><div class="section"><p>• Delivering on our ambition to reinvent productivity and business processes and multiplying opportunities for </p></div><div class="section"><p>customers to realize value </p></div><div class="section"><p>• Partnering with other technology providers to remove friction and accelerate customers’ digital transformations and </p></div><div class="section"><p>executing strategic acquisitions to broaden our reach </p></div></div><h1>Continued Innovation and Growth </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>As we move into the era of ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence, Microsoft is committed to its mission of empowering </p></div><div class="section"><p>every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

The artificial </p></div><div class="section"><p>intelligence (“AI”) moment has arrived, and under Mr. Nadella’s leadership, Microsoft is well positioned to seize the opportunity to </p></div><div class="section"><p>have a positive impact for customers and partners across the globe.

It was built to unlock a vast array of infrastructure-as-a-service </p></div><div class="section"><p>(“IaaS”), platform-as-a-service (“PaaS”), and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions. We have developed – and continue to create – </p></div><div class="section"><p>scores of offerings that build on Azure’s capabilities and multiply its usefulness. Offerings include AI services, such as Azure OpenAI </p></div><div class="section"><p>Service; Azure Arc for management; Azure Synapse and Microsoft Fabric for data storage, integration, and analytics; and Power BI </p></div><div class="section"><p>to glean and access data insights from across the enterprise. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Mr. Nadella has stated we aimed to build Azure as the “world’s computer.” We’ve built a global footprint, with 68 operating regions </p></div><div class="section"><p>in 24 countries. Microsoft Cloud revenue, which includes other cloud offerings such as Office 365 Commercial and Dynamics 365, </p></div><div class="section"><p>exceeded $110 billion, with Azure accounting for more than 50% of the total. </p></div></div><h1>Security</h1><div class="section"><div class="section"></div><div class="section"><p>as a comprehensive security vendor for customers’ entire range of interoperating products from Microsoft and other companies. </p></div><div class="section"><p>With over one million customers, our security business surpassed $20 billion of annual revenue.

We are bringing those same benefits to nearly 75 million consumers who have </p></div><div class="section"><p>subscribed to Microsoft 365. AI will further enhance our ability to help make customers more productive. We have announced that</p></div><div class="section"><p>our Microsoft 365 Copilot offering, which brings together next-generation AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph, all within </p></div><div class="section"><p>the applications that millions of people use every day, will be generally available to customers on November 1, 2023. </p></div></div><h1>Power Platform</h1><div class="section"><div class="section"></div><div class="section"><p>business solutions together. With over 33 million monthly active users, Power Platform comprises an end-to-end suite of tools to </p></div><div class="section"><p>automate workflows, create apps, build virtual agents, and analyze data. Because non-IT professionals can learn and use Power </p></div><div class="section"><p>Platform, subject matter experts who are closest to the workflow can use low-code or no-code tools to improve business processes. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Our recently announced Copilot for Power Platform will further enable no-code development. More than 126,000 organizations </p></div><div class="section"><p>have experienced Copilot in Power Platform. </p></div></div><h1>GitHub</h1><div class="section"><div class="section"></div><div class="section"><p>GitHub Copilot is a first-of-its-kind AI-based programmer that helps developers write better code faster. When enabled, GitHub </p></div><div class="section"><p>Copilot writes up to 46% of the code, greatly increasing developer productivity. Over one million people have used GitHub Copilot </p></div><div class="section"><p>and over 27,000 organizations utilize GitHub Copilot for Business. GitHub expanded features to transform it from simply a source </p></div><div class="section"><p>code management platform to an entire suite for development, security, and operations, with features such as continuous </p></div><div class="section"><p>integration/continuous delivery and package management in our Codespaces service. GitHub Advanced Security allows developers </p></div><div class="section"><p>to scan code for vulnerabilities, secrets, tokens, and other issues that can compromise secure code, and ensure all dependencies </p></div><div class="section"><p>and open-source components are up to date. </p></div></div><h1>Reinventing Productivity </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Microsoft is continually building connections between our products and services in ways that create powerful new levels of utility. </p></div></div><h1>Microsoft Teams</h1><div class="section"><div class="section"></div><div class="section"><p>monthly active users, is one example of how we develop these synergies. Teams itself has also become a first-class platform for</p></div><div class="section"><p>application development, as the number of third-party apps with more than 10,000 users increased nearly 40 percent year-over</p></div><div class="section"><p>year.

Our analytics and machine learning tools drive productivity gains by </p></div><div class="section"><p>transforming unstructured data into actionable information that supports operational reliability, effective supply chain </p></div><div class="section"><p>management, and rapid product innovation. </p></div></div><h1>Industry clouds</h1><div class="section"><div class="section"></div><div class="section"><p>capabilities across the entire Microsoft Cloud, along with industry-specific customizations, to improve time to value, increase  agility, </p></div><div class="section"><p>and lower costs. Our Clouds for Healthcare, Financial Services, Manufacturing, and Retail leverage customized combinations of </p></div><div class="section"><p>products and services to overcome business challenges specific to each of those verticals.

Our Cloud for Nonprofit </p></div><div class="section"><p>helps charitable organizations unlock the power of their data to achieve more transformative impact. </p></div></div><h1>Advertising. </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"></div><div class="section"><p>strategic acquisitions. Our global reach and product breadth allows us to serve the needs of digital advertisers across both </p></div><div class="section"><p>business-to-consumer advertising with Bing search engine and business-to-business advertising with LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. </p></div><div class="section"><p>With the introduction of the new Bing in 2023, we are bringing the power of AI directly into the search experience, driving </p></div><div class="section"><p>increased relevance for users and creating new monetization opportunities for marketers and publishers on the web. </p></div></div><h1>Partnering and Integrating </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>We partner with many of the leading enterprise technology companies to empower customers and grow market opportunities </p></div><div class="section"><p>together. In July of 2023, we announced support of Meta’s large language models on Azure and Windows. We have partnered with </p></div><div class="section"><p>both Databricks and Snowflake to provide our customers with the broadest array of data and analytics solutions. We have </p></div><div class="section"><p>developed a service with Oracle to accelerate adoption of Oracle workloads on Azure, making Microsoft the only public cloud with </p></div><div class="section"><p>simplified direct access to Oracle databases running on Oracle Cloud. Through our collaboration with SAP, we’ve built a pathway</p></div><div class="section"><p>for customers to migrate their SAP workloads to the cloud to take advantage of lower costs, increased agility, and reduced risk. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Through the Azure VMware Solution, we have enabled enterprises to seamlessly move VMware-based workloads from their </p></div><div class="section"><p>datacenters to Azure and integrate their VMware environments with Azure. In our rapidly growing security business, we have over</p></div><div class="section"><p>15,000 partners in our ecosystem working with us to bring better solutions and more choices to market. Now, instead of one </p></div><div class="section"><p>conversation on productivity, another on infrastructure, and yet another on business applications, our customer conversation can </p></div><div class="section"><p>revolve around how all these products more seamlessly merge, whether it’s our software alone, or a combination of ours and </p></div><div class="section"><p>partner solutions. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Mr. Nadella has been bold and visionary in finding strategic acquisitions that build on and enhance our core offerings. LinkedIn, </p></div><div class="section"><p>with its services that help both employers and workers network, grow professionally, and find one another, has shown consistent</p></div><div class="section"><p>and strong growth since we acquired it in 2016. LinkedIn revenue grew to $15 billion in fiscal year 2023. Similarly, GitHub has</p></div><div class="section"><p>continued to strengthen its position as the preferred platform for developers since its acquisition in 2018 and is used by over</p></div><div class="section"><p>100 million developers and 76% of the Fortune 500. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Our acquisition of Activision Blizzard as an investment will make it easier for people to play great games wherever, whenever, and </p></div><div class="section"><p>however they want. We expect the transaction will increase innovation in content creation and reduce constraints on distribution. It </p></div><div class="section"><p>also significantly expands our presence in mobile, the largest segment in the gaming business. </p></div><div class="section"><p>These examples of innovation, synergy, and partnership are far from exhaustive. They provide a view, however, into the diverse and </p></div><div class="section"><p>innovative set of technologies and products Microsoft has built under Mr. Nadella’s leadership. It is a multi-faceted engine of</p></div><div class="section"><p>growth that provides more avenues for continued success. The uses for Microsoft’s technology toolbox are as expansive as our </p></div><div class="section"><p>customers’ imaginations. Mr. Nadella has quite intentionally conditioned Microsoft’s success on that of our customers – while </p></div><div class="section"><p>providing the platform and technologies on which our customers will achieve it. This is a durable strategy that can thrive through </p></div><div class="section"><p>economic cycles, business disruptions, and the ever-increasing pace of change that characterizes the current global marketplace, </p></div><div class="section"><p>precisely because Microsoft enables companies and individuals to successfully address those very challenges. </p></div></div><h1>Environmental and Social Leadership </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>At Microsoft, we focus on four enduring commitments that are central to meeting our mission and that become even more important</p></div><div class="section"><p>in the era of AI: to expand opportunity, earn trust, protect fundamental rights, and advance sustainability.

In fiscal year 2023, we reported that in fiscal year 2022, our business grew by </p></div><div class="section"><p>18 percent and our overall emissions declined by 0.5 percent </p></div><div class="section"><p>• Microsoft is a strong advocate for privacy protection around the globe and offers both our commercial and individual customers</p></div><div class="section"><p>tools to help protect and manage their data.

The current technology labor market is hyper-competitive</p></div><div class="section"><p>with demand growing faster than the supply of specialized technical talent, resulting in significant increases in compensation at </p></div><div class="section"><p>many of the companies with which we compete for this talent. The same conditions exist in the market for executive-level talent</p></div><div class="section"><p>that can provide innovative leadership while managing at a global scale across several complex businesses. We expect these trends </p></div><div class="section"><p>to continue and will work to ensure our approach to executive compensation is responsive to evolving market conditions. </p></div></div><h1>Approach to Compensation Benchmarking </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>To ensure that our Board and Compensation Committee have current information to set appropriate compensation levels, we </p></div><div class="section"><p>conduct an executive compensation market analysis each year that draws from third-party compensation surveys and publicly </p></div><div class="section"><p>available data for a group of peer companies. We supplement this analysis with additional market information specific to each </p></div><div class="section"><p>executive’s role and responsibilities, including information gleaned from our experience recruiting for executive positions at </p></div><div class="section"><p>Microsoft. While this market analysis and supplemental data inform the decisions of the independent members of our Board and </p></div><div class="section"><p>our Compensation Committee on the range of compensation opportunities, we do not tie Named Executive compensation to </p></div><div class="section"><p>specific market percentiles. Because other companies actively recruit our executives to fill CEO and other senior leadership </p></div><div class="section"><p>positions, we supplement market information with data on external opportunities potentially available to our executives. We also </p></div><div class="section"><p>consider the relationship of annual target compensation among internal peers. </p></div><div class="section"><p>In setting our fiscal year 2023 executive compensation program design and compensation levels, we considered pay practices at </p></div><div class="section"><p>the largest technology and general industry companies that our Compensation Committee believes are led by executives with </p></div><div class="section"><p>similarly complex roles and responsibilities.

In </p></div><div class="section"><p>addition to the standard benefits offered to all U.S. employees, we maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for our U.S. </p></div><div class="section"><p>executive officers and senior managers. This deferred compensation plan is unfunded, and participation is voluntary. The deferred </p></div><div class="section"><p>compensation plan allows our Named Executives to defer their base salary, the cash portion of their Incentive Plan awards, and </p></div><div class="section"><p>certain on-hire bonuses.

Deloitte & Touche presented the matters required to be discussed with the Committee by Public </p></div><div class="section"><p>Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) standards and Rule 2-07 of SEC Regulation S-X. This review included a discussion </p></div><div class="section"><p>with management and the independent auditor of the quality (not merely the acceptability) of Microsoft’s accounting principles,</p></div><div class="section"><p>the reasonableness of significant estimates and judgments, and the disclosures in Microsoft’s consolidated financial statements, </p></div><div class="section"><p>including the disclosures relating to critical accounting policies. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Based on the reviews and discussions described above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the </p></div><div class="section"><p>audited consolidated financial statements be included in Microsoft’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, </p></div><div class="section"><p>2023, for filing with the SEC. </p></div></div><h1>Independent Auditor Tenure and Rotation </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>As part of its auditor engagement process, the Audit Committee considers whether to rotate the independent audit firm.

The Committee selected the current Deloitte & Touche lead audit engagement partner beginning with the fiscal year 2020</p></div><div class="section"><p>audit. The Audit Committee believes there are significant benefits to having an independent auditor with an extensive history with </p></div><div class="section"><p>the Company. These include: </p></div><div class="section"><p>• Higher quality audit work and accounting advice due to Deloitte & Touche’s institutional knowledge of our business and </p></div><div class="section"><p>operations, accounting policies and financial systems, and internal control framework </p></div><div class="section"><p>• Operational efficiencies and a resulting lower fee structure because of Deloitte & Touche’s history and familiarity with our </p></div><div class="section"><p>business </p></div></div><h1>Independence and Performance of Outside Audit Firm </h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>The Audit Committee recognizes the importance of maintaining the independence of Microsoft’s independent auditor, both in fact </p></div><div class="section"><p>and appearance, and takes a number of measures to ensure independence.

The Committee has established a policy </p></div><div class="section"><p>pursuant to which all services, audit and non-audit, provided by the independent auditor must be pre-approved by the Committee </p></div><div class="section"><p>or its delegate. This policy prohibits the independent auditor from providing non-audit services such as bookkeeping or financial </p></div><div class="section"><p>systems design and implementation.

Such policies have significant societal, </p></div><div class="section"><p>operational, reputational, and competitive risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining diverse talent. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Similarly, the Company provides health benefits to employees who suffer gender dysphoria/confusion, and who seek medical, </p></div><div class="section"><p>chemical, and/or surgical treatments to aid their “transition” to their non-biological sex. The Company reports, “Not only was </p></div><div class="section"><p>Microsoft an early leader in including sexual orientation in its corporate non-discrimination policy, but it continues to evolve to </p></div><div class="section"><p>support employees – for instance, by broadening its health benefits to encompass medical needs for US-based transgender </p></div><div class="section"><p>employees and their transgender dependents.”2</p></div><div class="section"><p>The Company has staked out a position on gender dysphoria/confusion which affirms that sufferers can transition to a different sex, </p></div><div class="section"><p>both psychologically and physically. Yet an increasing body of scientific evidence shows distinct harms actually result from medical </p></div><div class="section"><p>and surgical “transition” treatments. Examples include various long-lasting side effects like chronic pain, sexual dysfunction,</p></div><div class="section"><p>unwanted hair loss and hair gain, menstrual irregularities, urinary problems, and other complications.3 Rather than resolve mental </p></div><div class="section"><p>health problems, such “gender affirming” care instead often exacerbates them. In such instances, patients who desire to </p></div><div class="section"><p>“de-transition” cannot find medical or insurance coverage that they need. Many of these sufferers litigate against those who misled </p></div><div class="section"><p>or mistreated them regarding the necessity and alleged “success” of “transition” therapies.4</p></div><div class="section"><p>Resolved: Shareholders request Microsoft report on median compensation and benefits gaps across gender as they address </p></div><div class="section"><p>reproductive and gender dysphoria care, including associated policy, reputational, competitive, operational and litigative risks, and </p></div><div class="section"><p>risks related to recruiting and retaining diverse talent.

Based on the </p></div><div class="section"><p>language of the proposal, the request for additional reporting appears to stem from animosity towards certain reproductive and </p></div><div class="section"><p>gender-related health benefits. We strongly believe the requested report is unnecessary given Microsoft’s strong existing pay </p></div><div class="section"><p>disclosures and the comprehensive and inclusive set of benefits we provide to Microsoft employees. We further believe such </p></div><div class="section"><p>reporting would be counter-productive to our efforts to recruit and retain diverse talent. </p></div><div class="section"><p>As a baseline of our existing pay disclosures, Microsoft has reported on pay equity since 2016 in support of our commitment to pay </p></div><div class="section"><p>employees equitably for substantially similar work. To further highlight the opportunity to continue to make progress on </p></div><div class="section"><p>representation at all levels of the Company, in our 2022 Global Diversity and Inclusion Report, we began disclosing the unadjusted </p></div><div class="section"><p>differences in median total pay for women inside and outside of the U.S., and for racial and ethnic minorities, Asian, Black and </p></div><div class="section"><p>African American, and Hispanic and Latinx employees in the U.S. </p></div><div class="section"><p>In terms of the benefits we offer, we believe it’s our responsibility to create an environment where people can do their best work – a </p></div><div class="section"><p>place where they can proudly be their authentic selves, and where they know their needs can be met. We are constantly listening  to </p></div><div class="section"><p>employee feedback to establish and evolve our benefits that creates a more diverse and inclusive environment and recognizes the</p></div><div class="section"><p>importance of employees to the continued success of Microsoft. We’ve worked to align our benefits to our culture, as guided by </p></div><div class="section"><p>this priority, evolving them to be more holistic and inclusive. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Our industry-leading employee benefits include but are not limited to health care benefits that rank amongst the top in our </p></div><div class="section"><p>industry.

Based on these reviews, we determine whether and to what extent we should remove the content in question. Finally, </p></div><div class="section"><p>while it does not directly relate to Government Takedown Requests, Microsoft also recently begun providing data on content </p></div><div class="section"><p>removal on the Xbox Live platform related to a range of issues from sexual content to fraud. </p></div><div class="section"><p>LinkedIn has issued reports on Government Content Removal Requests since 2018, which are updated twice yearly.

You’ll find </p></div><div class="section"><p>Microsoft technology throughout the United States military, helping power its front office, field operations, bases, ships, aircraft, </p></div><div class="section"><p>and training facilities. As Microsoft bid on some significant new military contracts over the past several years, Microsoft’s Senior </p></div><div class="section"><p>Leadership Team deliberated and made a principled decision that we’re not going to withhold technology from institutions that we </p></div><div class="section"><p>have elected in democracies to protect the freedoms we enjoy. As technologies evolve and new capabilities emerge, we remain </p></div><div class="section"><p>committed to ensuring that our military is at the forefront of that technology. </p></div><div class="section"><p>We’ve communicated that position with employees and in external communications like blog posts. As a result, we do not believe </p></div><div class="section"><p>the requested third-party analyses would advance the interests of Microsoft, its shareholders, or other stakeholders. </p></div><div class="section"><p>To summarize our approach: </p></div><div class="section"><p>• First, we are committed to providing our technology to the United States military and our expertise and perspective on </p></div><div class="section"><p>technology issues ranging from cybersecurity to the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence. We depend on the military to defend  our </p></div><div class="section"><p>country, and we want it to have access to the best technology the country has to defend it, including from Microsoft. </p></div><div class="section"><p>• Second, we will not only be active but proactive in working to address the ethical issues that new technology creates for the </p></div><div class="section"><p>military. In a democratic country like the United States, where the military is accountable to civilian authorities, we believe  the </p></div><div class="section"><p>best way for us to address this is not to withhold our technology but rather to engage in discussions with the country’s </p></div><div class="section"><p>institutions, including testimony before Congress, engagement with the Executive Branch, and the military itself. As we’ve worked </p></div><div class="section"><p>to implement our own Responsible AI principles, we’ve worked to share with customers like the military our learnings and </p></div><div class="section"><p>approach including our own internal Responsible AI Standard and a broad set of tools to facilitate the responsible assessment, </p></div><div class="section"><p>development, and deployment of AI solutions. As we share information with those in the military and the government about AI </p></div><div class="section"><p>technologies, equally we have a lot to learn ourselves by engaging with these institutions about this ethical field. </p></div><div class="section"><p>• Third, we understand that some employees may have different views.

The committee has worked diligently to offer participants a broad range of </p></div><div class="section"><p>investment strategies across different asset classes and investment styles, to allow participants to diversify their investments and </p></div><div class="section"><p>pursue their individual retirement objectives based on their own risk tolerance. This includes access to investment options that take </p></div><div class="section"><p>into account or specifically focus on green energy and climate solutions, in accordance with the committee’s fiduciary duties. </p></div><div class="section"><p>The proposal incorrectly asserts or implies that Microsoft  is “investing employees’ retirement savings” in the BlackRock LifePath </p></div><div class="section"><p>target date funds, or certain other available strategies, which allegedly make outsized contributions to climate change. To the</p></div><div class="section"><p>contrary, almost all participants in the plan are required to affirmatively elect their own investments amongst a broad range of </p></div><div class="section"><p>diverse strategies. Indeed, as the proposal itself acknowledges, the vast majority of plan assets currently are not  invested in the </p></div><div class="section"><p>BlackRock LifePath funds. The Microsoft 401(k) plan offers a carefully curated and closely monitored investment lineup, in </p></div><div class="section"><p>accordance with the strict fiduciary requirements imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), as </p></div><div class="section"><p>implemented by Department of Labor regulations and guidance. </p></div><div class="section"><p>In November 2022, the Department of Labor issued amended final rules relating to fiduciaries’ consideration of ESG or other factors </p></div><div class="section"><p>in selecting plan investment alternatives.1  In accordance with those rules, the plan’s governing investment guidelines provide </p></div><div class="section"><p>maximum flexibility under the law with regard to the consideration of ESG and other factors. The plan’s fiduciary committee is </p></div><div class="section"><p>committed to evaluating plan offerings on an ongoing basis with due consideration of any changes in the law and the investment </p></div><div class="section"><p>marketplace as a whole. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Of note, nearly all of the investment managers for funds offered in the Microsoft 401(k) plan’s core lineup are signatories to the UN </p></div><div class="section"><p>Principles on Responsible Investment, and all plan investments already incorporate ESG factors into their investment process and </p></div><div class="section"><p>practices, to varying extents. </p></div><div class="section"><p>Recognizing the diverse interests of employees and participants in having access to a wide range of additional investment options </p></div><div class="section"><p>and strategies, including funds focused on green energy and other ESG initiatives, the Microsoft 401(k) plan’s self-directed </p></div><div class="section"><p>brokerage window offers hundreds of ESG-themed options. The plan also has made a number of enhancements to streamline and </p></div><div class="section"><p>simplify the process for enrolling in the self-directed brokerage window and filtering available investment options to identify  those </p></div><div class="section"><p>that are classified as ESG-themed. For example, Microsoft worked with the plan’s recordkeeper to facilitate a one-click search tool </p></div><div class="section"><p>to identify the numerous available “Socially Responsible Investment” options, and regular email communications to plan </p></div><div class="section"><p>participants specifically call out that tool as a resource. </p></div><div class="section"><p>In summary, the Microsoft 401(k) plan offers participants a broad range of core investment options in accordance with prevailing </p></div><div class="section"><p>ERISA fiduciary standards, and all investment managers for those offerings analyze ESG factors in their investment process and </p></div><div class="section"><p>practices. The plan also allows participants to choose from a wide range of other investment alternatives, including hundreds of </p></div><div class="section"><p>climate-friendly and other ESG-themed options that can be easily identified and filtered, via the self-directed brokerage window. </p></div><div class="section"><p>The proposal does not account for the current operations of the Microsoft 401(k) plan or the strict fiduciary framework under </p></div><div class="section"><p>ERISA. Moreover, the requested report would require an unnecessary expenditure of company resources, and would not affect the </p></div><div class="section"><p>menu of funds actually available for selection in the plan. </p></div><div class="section"><p></p></div><div class="section"><p>1 At least two lawsuits have been filed, in separate federal district courts, that seek to invalidate the Department of Labor’s  amended final rules.

Fifty-One Microsoft subsidiaries currently file statutory </p></div><div class="section"><p>reports which are publicly available. Microsoft also publishes tax strategy statements as required in the United Kingdom, Poland, </p></div><div class="section"><p>and Singapore which set out our approach to managing the Company’s tax affairs. </p></div><div class="section"><p>In addition, Microsoft currently provides annual country-by-country reports on a confidential basis to tax authorities as agreed by </p></div><div class="section"><p>countries participating in the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (“OECD”). These reports include specific tax</p></div><div class="section"><p>information by country and are shared among tax authorities providing them with information to undertake a high-level risk </p></div><div class="section"><p>assessment of our tax affairs.

Microsoft’s participation  as a </p></div><div class="section"><p>member of these various industry and trade groups comes with the understanding that we may not always agree with each </p></div><div class="section"><p>position taken by the larger organization and/or other members.
