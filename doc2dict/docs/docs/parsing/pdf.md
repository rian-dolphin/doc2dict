# PDF

## Goal
Ideally match HTML parser benchmark of 500 pages per second

## Benchmarks
pypdfium2 ~ 200 pages per second. That's fine.

## TODO
figure out new line
look at bindings for possibly useful stuff
think about tables
get center
get other old attributes like indent
test with adobe 10k pdf

## Issues
* Adobe PDF encodings return weird characters.

## Misc
* Estimating crude measure of font-size from bounding box.
