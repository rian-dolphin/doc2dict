Target Benchmark:
~200 pages per second, single threaded.

# To work on:
* mapping dicitonary - should set hierarchy -> pull all headers -> algorithm to guess hierarchy
* remember to pull out header if on first line. - we should probably do this in instruction_list
* prob add is section header. - nope. we need to do this in mapping part.
* Merge across lines

## 
* indents - indents seem off.



## Table
* add indents -> lets us do sub tables better.
* Fake Table detection
* '(' and ')'
