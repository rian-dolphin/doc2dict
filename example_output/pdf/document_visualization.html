As I write this, the world faces ongoing economic,</p></div><div class="section"><p>social, and geopolitical volatility. At the same time, we have entered a new age of AI that will fundamentally</p></div><div class="section"><p>transform productivity for every individual, organization, and industry on earth, and help us address some of our</p></div><div class="section"><p>most pressing challenges.</p></div><div class="section"><p>This next generation of AI will reshape every software category and every business, including our own. Forty-eight</p></div><div class="section"><p>years after its founding, Microsoft remains a consequential company because time and time again—from PC/Server,</p></div><div class="section"><p>to Web/Internet, to Cloud/Mobile—we have adapted to technological paradigm shifts. Today, we are doing so once</p></div><div class="section"><p>again, as we lead this new era.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Amid this transformation, our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to</p></div><h2>achieve more </h2><div class="section"><div class="section"></div><div class="section"><p>generation of technology and the opportunity it will help unlock for every country, community, and individual, while</p></div><div class="section"><p>mitigating its risks.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Here are just a few examples of how we are already doing this:</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Leading electronic health records vendor Epic is addressing some of the biggest challenges facing the</p></div><div class="section"><p>healthcare industry today—including physician burnout—by deploying a wide range of copilot solutions</p></div><div class="section"><p>built on Azure OpenAI Service and Dragon Ambient eXperience Copilot.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Mercado Libre is reducing the time its developers spend writing code by more than 50 percent with GitHub</p></div><div class="section"><p>Copilot, as the company works to democratize e-commerce across Latin America.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Mercedes-Benz is making its in-car voice assistant more intuitive for hundreds of thousands of drivers using</p></div><div class="section"><p>ChatGPT via the Azure OpenAI Service.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Lumen Technologies is helping its employees be more productive, enabling them to focus on higher value</p></div><div class="section"><p>added activities, by deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Nonprofit The Contingent is matching foster families with children in need using Dynamics 365, Power BI,</p></div><div class="section"><p>and Azure, with an eye on using AI to amplify its work across the US.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• And, Taiwan’s Ministry of Education has built an online platform to help elementary and high school</p></div><div class="section"><p>students learn English using Azure AI.</p></div><div class="section"><p>To build on this progress, we remain convicted on three things: First, we will maintain our lead as the top commercial</p></div><div class="section"><p>cloud while innovating in consumer categories, from gaming to professional social networks. Second, because we</p></div><div class="section"><p>know that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts like this one, we will invest to accelerate our</p></div><div class="section"><p>lead in AI by infusing this technology across every layer of the tech stack. And, finally, we will continue to drive</p></div><div class="section"><p>operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth.</p></div><div class="section"><p>As we make progress on these priorities, we delivered strong results in fiscal year 2023, including a record</p></div><div class="section"><p>$211 billion in revenue and over $88 billion in operating income.</p></div></div><h2>A NEW ERA OF AI</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>There are two breakthroughs coming together to define this new era of AI. The first is the most universal interface:</p></div><div class="section"><p>natural language. The long arc of computing has, in many ways, been shaped by the pursuit of increasingly intuitive</p></div><div class="section"><p>human-computer interfaces—keyboards, mice, touch screens. We believe we have now arrived at the next big step</p></div><div class="section"><p>forward—natural language—and will quickly go beyond, to see, hear, interpret, and make sense of our intent and the</p></div><div class="section"><p>world around us.</p></div><div class="section"><p>1</p></div><div class="section"><p>The second is the emergence of a powerful new reasoning engine. For years, we’ve digitized daily life, places, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>things and organized them into databases. But in a world rich with data, what has been most scarce is our ability to</p></div><div class="section"><p>reason over it. This generation of AI helps us interact with data in powerful new ways—from completing or</p></div><div class="section"><p>summarizing text, to detecting anomalies and recognizing images—to help us identify patterns and surface insights</p></div><div class="section"><p>faster than ever.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Together, these two breakthroughs will unlock massive new opportunity. And, in fact, just last month we announced</p></div><div class="section"><p>our vision for Copilot, an everyday AI companion. We are building Copilot into all our most used products and</p></div><div class="section"><p>experiences and allowing people to summon its power as a standalone app as well. Just like you boot up an OS to</p></div><div class="section"><p>access applications or use a browser to visit websites today, our belief is that you will invoke a Copilot to do all those</p></div><div class="section"><p>activities and more: to shop, to code, to analyze, to learn, to create.</p></div><div class="section"><p>As a company, any time we approach a transition like this, we do so responsibly. We believe AI should be as</p></div><div class="section"><p>empowering across communities as it is powerful, and we’re committed to ensuring it is responsibly built and</p></div><div class="section"><p>designed, with safety in mind from the outset.</p></div></div><h2>OUR OPPORTUNITY</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Every customer solution area and every layer of our tech stack will be reimagined for the AI era. And that’s exactly</p></div><div class="section"><p>what we’ve already begun to do:</p></div></div><h2>Infrastructure</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Four years ago, we first invested in our AI supercomputer, with a goal of building the best cloud for training and</p></div><div class="section"><p>inference. Today, it’s being used by our partner OpenAI to power its best-in-class foundation models and services,</p></div><div class="section"><p>including one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever—ChatGPT. NVIDIA, as well as leading AI startups like</p></div><div class="section"><p>Adept and Inflection, is also using our infrastructure to build its own breakthrough models.</p></div><div class="section"><p>More broadly, organizations continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric—from cloud to edge—to run their</p></div><div class="section"><p>mission-critical applications. We continued to see more cloud migrations to Azure this past fiscal year, as it remains</p></div><div class="section"><p>early when it comes to the long-term cloud opportunity. And we also continue to lead in hybrid computing with</p></div><div class="section"><p>Azure Arc, which now has 18,000 customers.</p></div></div><h2>Data and AI</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Every AI app starts with data, and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, and governance so organizations can</p></div><div class="section"><p>spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. We also introduced Microsoft Fabric this</p></div><div class="section"><p>year, which unifies compute, storage, and governance with a disruptive business model.</p></div><div class="section"><p>With Azure AI, we are making foundation models available as platforms to our customers. We offer the best</p></div><div class="section"><p>selection of industry-leading frontier and open models. In January, we made the Azure OpenAI Service broadly</p></div><div class="section"><p>available, bringing together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, with the enterprise capabilities of</p></div><div class="section"><p>Azure. More than 11,000 organizations across industries are already using it for advanced scenarios like content and</p></div><div class="section"><p>code generation. Meta chose us this summer as its preferred cloud to commercialize its Llama family of models. And,</p></div><div class="section"><p>with Azure AI Studio, we provide a full lifecycle toolchain customers can use to ground these models on their own</p></div><div class="section"><p>data, create prompt workflows, and help ensure they are deployed and used safely.</p></div></div><h2>Digital and app innovation</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>GitHub Copilot is fundamentally transforming developer productivity, helping developers complete coding tasks</p></div><div class="section"><p>55 percent faster. More than 27,000 organizations have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business, and to date more than</p></div><div class="section"><p>2</p></div><div class="section"><p>1 million people have used GitHub Copilot to code faster. We also announced our vision for the future of software</p></div><div class="section"><p>development with GitHub Copilot X, which will bring the power of AI throughout the entire software development</p></div><div class="section"><p>lifecycle. All up, GitHub surpassed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue for the first time this fiscal year.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We’re also applying AI across our low-code/no-code toolchain to help domain experts across an organization</p></div><div class="section"><p>automate workflows, create apps and webpages, build virtual agents, or analyze data, using just natural language</p></div><div class="section"><p>with copilots in Power Platform. More than 63,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power</p></div><div class="section"><p>Platform to date.</p></div></div><h2>Business applications</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>We are bringing the next generation of AI to employees across every job function and every line of business with</p></div><div class="section"><p>Dynamics 365 Copilot, which works across CRM and ERP systems to reduce burdensome tasks like manual data</p></div><div class="section"><p>entry, content generation, and notetaking. In fact, our own support agents are using Copilot in Dynamics 365</p></div><div class="section"><p>Customer Service to resolve more cases faster and without having to call on peers to help. With our Supply Chain</p></div><div class="section"><p>Platform, we’re helping customers apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions. And, with our new Microsoft Sales</p></div><div class="section"><p>Copilot, sellers can infuse their customer interactions with data from CRM systems—including both Salesforce and</p></div><div class="section"><p>Dynamics—to close more deals.</p></div><div class="section"><p>All up, Dynamics surpassed $5 billion in revenue over the past fiscal year, with our customer experience, service, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>finance and supply chain businesses each surpassing $1 billion in annual sales.</p></div></div><h2>Industry</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Across industries, we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any organization looking to generate real value</p></div><div class="section"><p>from AI. In healthcare, for example, we introduced the world’s first fully automated clinical documentation</p></div><div class="section"><p>application, DAX Copilot. The application helps physicians reduce documentation time by half, freeing them to spend</p></div><div class="section"><p>more time face to face with patients. And Epic will integrate it directly into its electronic health records system.</p></div><div class="section"><p>And, in retail, we introduced new tools to help companies manage their day-to-day operations and digitize their</p></div><div class="section"><p>physical stores.</p></div></div><h2>Modern work</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>We are rapidly evolving Microsoft 365 into an AI-first platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity</p></div><div class="section"><p>and productivity, with both our established applications like Office and Teams, as well as new apps like Designer,</p></div><div class="section"><p>Stream, and Loop. Microsoft 365 is designed for today’s digitally connected, distributed workforce.</p></div><div class="section"><p>This year, we also introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot, which combines next</p></div><div class="section"><p>generation AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications to help people be more</p></div><div class="section"><p>productive and unleash their creativity at work. Just last month, I was excited to announce that we will make</p></div><div class="section"><p>Microsoft 365 Copilot generally available to our commercial customers later this year.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We continue to build momentum in Microsoft Teams across collaboration, chat, meetings, and calls. We introduced a</p></div><div class="section"><p>new version of Teams that delivers up to two times faster performance, while using 50 percent less memory. We also</p></div><div class="section"><p>introduced Teams Premium to meet enterprise demand for AI-powered features like intelligent meeting recaps. All</p></div><div class="section"><p>up, Teams usage surpassed 300 million monthly active users this year.</p></div><div class="section"><p>With Microsoft Viva, we have created a new category for employee experience. Copilot in Viva offers leaders a new</p></div><div class="section"><p>way to build high-performance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement. This year, Viva</p></div><div class="section"><p>surpassed 35 million monthly active users.</p></div><div class="section"><p>3</p></div></div><h2>Security</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>As the rate and pace of cyberthreats continue to accelerate, security is a top priority for every organization. Our</p></div><div class="section"><p>comprehensive, AI-powered solutions give defenders the advantage. With Security Copilot, we’re combining large</p></div><div class="section"><p>language models with a domain-specific model informed by our threat intelligence and 65 trillion daily security</p></div><div class="section"><p>signals, to transform every aspect of security operations center productivity.</p></div><div class="section"><p>All up, more than 1 million organizations now count on our comprehensive, AI-powered solutions to protect their</p></div><div class="section"><p>digital estates, and our security business surpassed $20 billion in annual revenue, as we help protect customers</p></div><div class="section"><p>across clouds and endpoint platforms.</p></div></div><h2>Search, advertising, and news</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>We are reshaping daily search and web habits with our new Bing and Microsoft Edge browser, which brings together</p></div><div class="section"><p>search, browsing, chat, and AI into one unified experience to deliver better search, more complete answers, a new</p></div><div class="section"><p>chat experience, and the ability to generate content. We think of these tools as an AI copilot for the web.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We are also bringing these breakthrough capabilities to businesses, with Bing Chat Enterprise, which offers</p></div><div class="section"><p>commercial data protection, providing an easy on-ramp for any organization looking to get the benefit of next</p></div><div class="section"><p>generation AI today.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Although it’s early in our journey, Bing users engaged in more than 1 billion chats and created more than 750 million</p></div><div class="section"><p>images over the past year as they apply these new tools to get things done. And Edge has taken share for nine</p></div><div class="section"><p>consecutive quarters.</p></div><div class="section"><p>More broadly, we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising. This year, Netflix chose us as its exclusive</p></div><div class="section"><p>technology and sales partner for its first ad-supported subscription offering, a validation of the differentiated value</p></div><div class="section"><p>we provide to any publisher looking for a flexible partner to build and innovate with them.</p></div></div><h2>LinkedIn</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>The excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function—from marketing, sales, service, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>finance, to software development and security. And LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn, discuss,</p></div><div class="section"><p>and uplevel their skills. We are using AI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into</p></div><div class="section"><p>the experiences of experts on the platform. In fact, our AI-powered articles are already the fastest-growing traffic</p></div><div class="section"><p>driver to the network.</p></div><div class="section"><p>All up, LinkedIn’s revenue surpassed $15 billion for the first time this fiscal year, a testament to how mission critical</p></div><div class="section"><p>the platform has become to help more than 950 million members connect, learn, sell, and get hired.</p></div></div><h2>Gaming</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>In gaming, we are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever,</p></div><div class="section"><p>wherever, and however they want. With Xbox Game Pass, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>viewed. Content is the flywheel behind the service’s growth, and our pipeline has never been stronger. It was</p></div><div class="section"><p>especially energizing to release Starfield this fall to broad acclaim, with more than 10 million players in the first</p></div><div class="section"><p>month post-launch alone.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Earlier this month, we were thrilled to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and we look forward to sharing</p></div><div class="section"><p>more in the coming months about how, together, we will bring the joy of gaming to more people around the world.</p></div><div class="section"><p>4</p></div></div><h2>Devices and creativity</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Finally, we’re turning Windows into a powerful new AI canvas with Copilot, which rolled out as part of a Windows 11</p></div><div class="section"><p>update last month. It uniquely incorporates the context and intelligence of the web, your work data, and what you</p></div><div class="section"><p>are doing in the moment on your PC to provide better assistance, while keeping your privacy and security at the</p></div><div class="section"><p>forefront. Overall, the number of devices running Windows 11 more than doubled in the past year. And we are also</p></div><div class="section"><p>transforming how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, which</p></div><div class="section"><p>together surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time.</p></div></div><h2>OUR RESPONSIBILITY</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>As we pursue our opportunity, we are also working to ensure technology helps us solve problems—not create new</p></div><div class="section"><p>ones. To do this, we focus on four enduring commitments that are central to our mission and that take on even</p></div><div class="section"><p>greater importance in this new era. For us, these commitments are more than just words. They’re a guide to help us</p></div><div class="section"><p>make decisions across everything we do—as we design and develop products, shape business processes and</p></div><div class="section"><p>policies, help our customers thrive, build partnerships, and more—always asking ourselves critical questions to</p></div><div class="section"><p>ensure our actions are aligned with them.</p></div></div><h2>How can we expand opportunity?</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>First, we believe access to economic growth and opportunity should reach every person, organization, community,</p></div><div class="section"><p>and country. And although AI can serve as a catalyst for opportunity and growth, we must first ensure everyone has</p></div><div class="section"><p>access to the technologies, data, and skills they need to benefit.</p></div><div class="section"><p>To achieve this, we are focused on getting technology into the hands of nonprofits, social entrepreneurs, and other</p></div><div class="section"><p>civil society organizations to help them digitally transform, so they can help address some of society’s biggest</p></div><div class="section"><p>challenges. This year, we provided nonprofits with over $3.8 billion in discounted and donated technology. Nearly</p></div><div class="section"><p>325,000 nonprofits used our cloud. And to help them tap the potential of AI, we’re building new AI capabilities for</p></div><div class="section"><p>fundraising, marketing, and program delivery.</p></div><div class="section"><p>AI will displace some jobs, but it will also create new ones. That’s why we aim to train and certify 10 million people by</p></div><div class="section"><p>2025 with the skills for jobs and livelihoods in an increasingly digital economy. Since July 2020, we’ve helped</p></div><div class="section"><p>8.5 million people, including 2.7 million this year. We’ve also focused on skilling women and underrepresented</p></div><div class="section"><p>communities in cybersecurity, working across 28 countries and with nearly 400 US community colleges to scale our</p></div><div class="section"><p>efforts.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Finally, to help people learn more about AI, we launched the first online Professional Certificate on Generative AI in</p></div><div class="section"><p>partnership with LinkedIn Learning, created AI tools for educators, and held our first AI Community Learning event in</p></div><div class="section"><p>the US. These events will be replicated around the world and localized in 10 languages over the next year. We also</p></div><div class="section"><p>partnered to launch a Generative AI Skills Grant Challenge to explore how nonprofit, social enterprise, and research</p></div><div class="section"><p>or academic institutions can empower the workforce to use this new generation of AI.</p></div></div><h2>How can we earn trust?</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>To create positive impact with technology, people need to be able to trust the technologies they use and the</p></div><div class="section"><p>companies behind them. For us, earning trust spans the responsible use of AI, protecting privacy, and advancing</p></div><div class="section"><p>digital safety and cybersecurity.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our commitment to responsible AI is not new. Since 2017, we’ve worked to develop our responsible AI practice,</p></div><div class="section"><p>recognizing that trust is never given but earned through action.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We have translated our AI principles into a core set of implementation processes, as well as tools, training, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>practices to support compliance. But internal programs aren’t enough. We also enable our customers and partners to</p></div><div class="section"><p>5</p></div><div class="section"><p>develop and deploy AI safely, including through our AI customer commitments and services like Azure AI Studio,</p></div><div class="section"><p>with its content safety tooling and access to our Responsible AI dashboard.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Building AI responsibly requires that we work with other industry leaders, civil society, and governments to advocate</p></div><div class="section"><p>for AI regulations and governance globally. This year, we released our Governing AI Blueprint, which outlines</p></div><div class="section"><p>concrete legal and policy recommendations for AI guardrails. We are signatories to the eight voluntary commitments</p></div><div class="section"><p>developed with the US White House, and proud of the six additional commitments we’ve made to further strengthen</p></div><div class="section"><p>and operationalize the principles of safety, security, and trust.</p></div><div class="section"><p>The era of AI heightens the importance of cybersecurity, and we deepened our work across the private and public</p></div><div class="section"><p>sectors to improve cyber-resilience. We’ve continued to support Ukraine in defending critical infrastructure,</p></div><div class="section"><p>detecting and disrupting cyberattacks and cyberinfluence operations, and providing intelligence related to these</p></div><div class="section"><p>attacks. Our Microsoft Threat Analysis Center team produced more than 500 intelligence reports to help keep</p></div><div class="section"><p>customers and the public informed. And we published our third annual Microsoft Digital Defense Report, sharing our</p></div><div class="section"><p>learnings and security recommendations.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We also remain committed to creating safe experiences online and protecting customers from illegal and harmful</p></div><div class="section"><p>content and conduct, while respecting human rights. We supported the Christchurch Call Initiative on Algorithmic</p></div><div class="section"><p>Outcomes to address terrorist and violent and extremist content online. And through the World Economic Forum’s</p></div><div class="section"><p>Global Coalition for Digital Safety, we co-led the development of new global principles for digital safety.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Protecting customers’ privacy and giving them control of their data is more important than ever. We’ve begun our</p></div><div class="section"><p>phased rollout of the EU Data Boundary, supporting our commercial and public sector customers’ need for data</p></div><div class="section"><p>sovereignty. And each month, more than 3 million people exercise their data protection rights through our privacy</p></div><div class="section"><p>dashboard, making meaningful choices about how their data is used.</p></div></div><h2>How can we protect fundamental rights?</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>In an increasingly digital world, we have a responsibility to promote and protect people’s fundamental rights and</p></div><div class="section"><p>address the challenges technology creates. For us, this means upholding responsible business practices, expanding</p></div><div class="section"><p>connectivity and accessibility, advancing fair and inclusive societies, and empowering communities.</p></div><div class="section"><p>In 2023, we worked diligently to anticipate harmful uses of our technology and put guardrails on the use of</p></div><div class="section"><p>technologies that are consequential to people’s lives or legal status, create risk of harm, or threaten human rights.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We will continue to assess the impact of our technologies, engage our stakeholders, and model and adopt</p></div><div class="section"><p>responsible practices and respect for human rights—including across our global supply chain.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Today, our lives are more connected than ever. Access to education, employment, healthcare, and other critical</p></div><div class="section"><p>services is increasingly dependent on technology. That’s why we’ve expanded our commitment to bring access to</p></div><div class="section"><p>affordable high-speed internet to a quarter of a billion people around the world, including 100 million people in</p></div><div class="section"><p>Africa, by the end of 2025. Since 2017, we’ve helped bring internet access to 63 million people, a key first step to</p></div><div class="section"><p>ensuring communities will have access to AI and other digital technologies.</p></div><div class="section"><p>This year, we also continued working toward our five-year commitment to bridge the disability divide with a focus on</p></div><div class="section"><p>helping close the accessibility knowledge gap. Seven hundred and fifty-thousand learners enriched their</p></div><div class="section"><p>understanding of disability and accessibility in partnership with LinkedIn Learning, Teach Access, and the Microsoft</p></div><div class="section"><p>disability community.</p></div><div class="section"><p>In addition, we’re stepping up efforts to combat online disinformation through new media content provenance</p></div><div class="section"><p>technologies—enabling users to verify if an image or video was generated by AI. We continued our efforts to</p></div><div class="section"><p>promote racial equity across Microsoft, our ecosystem, and our communities, including our work to advance justice</p></div><div class="section"><p>reform through data-driven insights. And we provided support in response to eight humanitarian disasters, including</p></div><div class="section"><p>committing $540 million of support to those who have been impacted by the War in Ukraine.</p></div><div class="section"><p>6</p></div><div class="section"><p>Finally, recognizing AI’s potential to advance human rights and humanitarian action, we worked on several AI for</p></div><div class="section"><p>Humanitarian Action projects. Together with our partners, we’re building the capabilities to identify at-risk</p></div><div class="section"><p>communities, estimate seasonal hunger, predict malnutrition, and assist in disease identification.</p></div></div><h2>How can we advance sustainability?</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Climate change is the defining issue of our generation, and addressing it requires swift, collective action and</p></div><div class="section"><p>technological innovation. We are committed to meeting our own goals while enabling others to do the same. That</p></div><div class="section"><p>means taking responsibility for our operational footprint and accelerating progress through technology.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We continue to see extreme weather impacting communities globally. To meet the urgent need, this must be a</p></div><div class="section"><p>decade of innovation and decisive action—for Microsoft, our customers, and the world.</p></div><div class="section"><p>In our latest Environmental Sustainability Report, we shared our progress toward our 2030 sustainability targets</p></div><div class="section"><p>across carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems. In 2022, our overall carbon emissions declined by 0.5 percent while our</p></div><div class="section"><p>business grew. Addressing scope 3 emissions, which account for the vast majority of our emissions, is arguably our</p></div><div class="section"><p>ultimate challenge—one we’ll continue to tackle through our supply chain, policy advances, and industry-wide</p></div><div class="section"><p>knowledge-sharing.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We’ve provided just under 1 million people with access to clean water and sanitation, one of five pillars on our path</p></div><div class="section"><p>to becoming water positive. And in our pursuit to be zero waste, we achieved a reuse and recycle rate of 82 percent</p></div><div class="section"><p>for all our cloud hardware and diverted over 12,000 metric tons of solid operational waste from landfills and</p></div><div class="section"><p>incinerators.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We also continue to take responsibility for the impacts of our direct operations on Earth’s ecosystems. We’ve</p></div><div class="section"><p>contracted to protect 17,268 acres of land, over 50 percent more than the land we use to operate. Of that, 12,270</p></div><div class="section"><p>acres—the equivalent of approximately 7,000 soccer fields—were designated as permanently protected.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Technology is a powerful lever to help us avoid the most severe impacts of climate change. That’s why we’re</p></div><div class="section"><p>accelerating our investment in more efficient datacenters, clean energy, enhancements to the Microsoft Cloud for</p></div><div class="section"><p>Sustainability and Planetary Computer, and green software practices. To date, through our Climate Innovation Fund,</p></div><div class="section"><p>we’ve allocated more than $700 million to a global portfolio of 50+ investments spanning sustainable solutions in</p></div><div class="section"><p>energy, industrial, and natural systems.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Finally, we believe AI can be a powerful accelerant in addressing the climate crisis. We expanded our AI for Good Lab</p></div><div class="section"><p>in Egypt and Kenya to improve climate resilience for the continent. And, together with our partners, we launched</p></div><div class="section"><p>Global Renewables Watch, a first-of-its-kind living atlas that aims to map and measure utility-scale solar and wind</p></div><div class="section"><p>installations, allowing users to evaluate progress toward a clean energy transition.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Although this new era promises great opportunity, it demands even greater responsibility from companies like ours.</p></div><div class="section"><p>As we pursue our four commitments, we focus on transparency—providing clear reporting on how we run our</p></div><div class="section"><p>business and how we work with customers and partners. Our annual Impact Summary shares more about our</p></div><div class="section"><p>progress and learnings this year, and our Reports Hub provides detailed reports on our environmental data, political</p></div><div class="section"><p>activities, workforce demographics, human rights work, and more.</p></div></div><h2>OUR CULTURE</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>There’s never been a more important time to live our culture. The way we work and the speed at which we work are</p></div><div class="section"><p>changing.</p></div><div class="section"><p>In an economy where yesterday’s exceptional is today’s expected, all of us at Microsoft will need to embrace a</p></div><div class="section"><p>growth mindset and, more importantly, confront our fixed mindsets as our culture evolves. It will take everyday</p></div><div class="section"><p>courage to reformulate what innovation, business models, and sales motions look like in this new era. As a</p></div><div class="section"><p>7</p></div><div class="section"><p>high-performance organization, we aspire to help our employees maximize their economic opportunity, while</p></div><div class="section"><p>simultaneously helping them learn and grow professionally and connect their own passion and purpose with their</p></div><div class="section"><p>everyday work and the company’s mission.</p></div><div class="section"><p>To be successful, we need to be grounded in what our customers and the world need. We need to innovate and</p></div><div class="section"><p>collaborate as One Microsoft. And we need to actively seek diversity and embrace inclusion to best serve our</p></div><div class="section"><p>customers and create a culture where everyone can do their best work. To empower the world, we need to represent</p></div><div class="section"><p>the world. To that end, we remain focused on increasing representation and strengthening our culture of inclusion.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Even as we navigated challenges this year, our company continued to be the most globally diverse it’s ever been.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Giving also remains core to our culture. This year, more than 105,000 employees gave $242 million (including</p></div><div class="section"><p>company match) to over 35,000 nonprofits in 116 countries. And our employees volunteered over 930,000 hours to</p></div><div class="section"><p>causes they care about.</p></div><div class="section"><p>I am deeply grateful to our employees for their commitment to the company and their communities, and how they</p></div><div class="section"><p>are living our mission and culture every day in a changing company and world.</p></div><div class="section"><p>**</p></div><div class="section"><p>In closing, this is Microsoft’s moment. We have an incredible opportunity to use this new era of AI to deliver</p></div><div class="section"><p>meaningful benefits for every person and every organization on the planet.</p></div><div class="section"><p>On New Year’s Day, I saw a tweet from Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s former director of AI who now works at OpenAI,</p></div><div class="section"><p>about how GitHub Copilot was writing about 80 percent of his code, with 80 percent accuracy. Two days later, I saw a</p></div><div class="section"><p>stunning example of work we’ve done with the government of India’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, which is applying</p></div><div class="section"><p>an AI model so farmers in rural areas can interact with government resources in their native languages.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Think about that: A foundation model that was developed on the West Coast of the United States is already</p></div><div class="section"><p>transforming the lives of both elite developers and rural farmers on the other side of the globe. We’ve not seen this</p></div><div class="section"><p>speed of diffusion and breadth of impact in the tech industry before.</p></div><div class="section"><p>As a company, this is our moment to show up and responsibly build solutions that drive economic growth and</p></div><div class="section"><p>benefit every community, country, industry, and person. If we do it well, the world will do well, and Microsoft will do</p></div><div class="section"><p>well too. I’ve never been more confident that we will deliver on this promise together in the days, months, and years</p></div><div class="section"><p>to come.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Satya Nadella</p></div><div class="section"><p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</p></div><div class="section"><p>October 16, 2023</p></div><div class="section"><p>8</p></div></div></div><h1>ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, DIVIDENDS, AND STOCK PERFORMANCE</h1><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>MARKET AND STOCKHOLDERS</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol MSFT.

We continued to make progress on our goals, with our overall emissions declining by 0.5 percent. While</p></div><div class="section"><p>our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions continued to decline, Scope 3 emissions increased by 0.5 percent. Scope 3</p></div><div class="section"><p>represented 96 percent of our total emissions, resulting primarily from the operations of our suppliers and the use of</p></div><div class="section"><p>our products across our customers.</p></div><div class="section"><p>A few examples of our continued progress include:</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Signed new power purchase agreements, bringing our total portfolio of carbon-free energy to over 13.5</p></div><div class="section"><p>gigawatts.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Contracted for water replenishment projects that are estimated to provide more than 15.6 million cubic</p></div><div class="section"><p>meters in volumetric water benefit over the lifetime of these projects.</p></div><div class="section"><p>15</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Diverted 12,159 metric tons of solid waste from landfills and incinerators across our direct operational</p></div><div class="section"><p>footprint.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Protected 12,270 acres of land in Belize – more than the 11,206 acres of land that we use around the world.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Microsoft has a role to play in developing and advancing new climate solutions, but we recognize that no solution</p></div><div class="section"><p>can be offered by any single company, organization, or government. Our approach helps to support the</p></div><div class="section"><p>sustainability needs of our customers and the global community. Our Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, an</p></div><div class="section"><p>environmental sustainability management platform that includes Microsoft Sustainability Manager, enables</p></div><div class="section"><p>organizations to record, report, and reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.

To address this, in June 2023 we launched a new AI Skills Initiative to help everyone learn how to harness</p></div><div class="section"><p>the power of AI. This includes a new LinkedIn learning pathway offering new coursework on learning the foundations</p></div><div class="section"><p>of generative AI. We also launched a new global grant challenge to uncover new ways of training workers on</p></div><div class="section"><p>generative AI and are providing greater access to digital learning events and resources for everyone to improve their</p></div><div class="section"><p>AI fluency.</p></div><div class="section"><p>HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES</p></div></div><h2>Overview</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Microsoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds.

These programs</p></div><div class="section"><p>reinforce our culture and values such as collaboration and growth mindset. Managers evaluate and recommend</p></div><div class="section"><p>rewards based on, for example, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our</p></div><div class="section"><p>colleagues. We monitor pay equity and career progress across multiple dimensions. Our total compensation</p></div><div class="section"><p>opportunity is highly differentiated and is market competitive.</p></div><div class="section"><p>In order to manage our costs in a dynamic, competitive environment, in fiscal year 2023 we announced that base</p></div><div class="section"><p>salaries of salaried employees would remain at fiscal year 2022 levels. Pay increases continue to be available for</p></div><div class="section"><p>rewards-eligible hourly and equivalent employees. We will continue our practice of investing in stock for all rewards</p></div><div class="section"><p>eligible employees, salaried and hourly, and investing in bonuses for all eligible employees.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Since 2016, we have reported on pay equity as part of our annual Diversity and Inclusion report.

For employees who are eligible for rewards, the</p></div><div class="section"><p>analysis showed that total pay for women is 89.6% of total pay for men in the U.S. and 86.2% outside of the U.S., and</p></div><div class="section"><p>total pay for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. is 89.9% of total pay for white employees. As we continue to</p></div><div class="section"><p>increase representation for women and racial and ethnic minorities at more senior levels, and continue to ensure pay</p></div><div class="section"><p>equity for all, the gap between the medians will reduce.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive</p></div><div class="section"><p>compensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance.</p></div></div><h2>Wellbeing and Hybrid Work</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Microsoft is committed to supporting our employees’ wellbeing while they are at work and in their personal lives.

We are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers</p></div><div class="section"><p>across a variety of different end points through our first- and third-party content and business diversification across</p></div><div class="section"><p>subscriptions, ads, and digital stores. We’ve seen new devices from third-party manufacturers along with key PC and</p></div><div class="section"><p>mobile end points that help us empower gamers to play in a way that is most convenient to them.

These</p></div><div class="section"><p>manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows</p></div><div class="section"><p>OEMs.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming</p></div><div class="section"><p>services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of</p></div><div class="section"><p>entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms</p></div><div class="section"><p>from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming</p></div><div class="section"><p>24</p></div><div class="section"><p>platform is effectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based</p></div><div class="section"><p>on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment</p></div><div class="section"><p>services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital</p></div><div class="section"><p>content offerings.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like</p></div><div class="section"><p>Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.</p></div><div class="section"><p>OPERATIONS</p></div><div class="section"><p>We have regional operations service centers that support our operations, including customer contract and order</p></div><div class="section"><p>processing, billing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics.

We continue to</p></div><div class="section"><p>identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the</p></div><div class="section"><p>evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on</p></div><div class="section"><p>the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including</p></div><div class="section"><p>graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we</p></div><div class="section"><p>have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our</p></div><div class="section"><p>requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified</p></div><div class="section"><p>suppliers.

It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications</p></div><div class="section"><p>and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as</p></div><div class="section"><p>early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware</p></div><div class="section"><p>design. Before releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we</p></div><div class="section"><p>provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Generally, we also create product documentation internally.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally</p></div><div class="section"><p>to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software</p></div><div class="section"><p>and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding.

While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property in our products and</p></div><div class="section"><p>services, we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into</p></div><div class="section"><p>licensees’ products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology</p></div><div class="section"><p>companies covering entire groups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into</p></div><div class="section"><p>our products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to</p></div><div class="section"><p>achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal</p></div><div class="section"><p>and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling our external development community. Our increasing</p></div><div class="section"><p>engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain</p></div><div class="section"><p>situations.</p></div><div class="section"><p>While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and</p></div><div class="section"><p>services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on</p></div><div class="section"><p>commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially</p></div><div class="section"><p>dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.</p></div></div><h2>Investing in the Future</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to</p></div><div class="section"><p>initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad</p></div><div class="section"><p>adoption of our products and services.

Our sales organization performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial</p></div><div class="section"><p>enterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital</p></div><div class="section"><p>transformation requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent</p></div><div class="section"><p>software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>fulfillment functions for our products and services.</p></div></div><h2>OEMs</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they</p></div><div class="section"><p>sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs</p></div><div class="section"><p>also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and</p></div><div class="section"><p>the capability to subscribe to Office 365.</p></div><div class="section"><p>There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with</p></div><div class="section"><p>them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements</p></div><div class="section"><p>covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard,</p></div><div class="section"><p>Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting</p></div><div class="section"><p>of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution</p></div><div class="section"><p>primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with</p></div><div class="section"><p>Microsoft.</p></div></div><h2>Direct</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements</p></div><div class="section"><p>and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web</p></div><div class="section"><p>agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement</p></div><div class="section"><p>Software Advisors” or “ESA”). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate</p></div><div class="section"><p>customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support</p></div><div class="section"><p>many of these sales.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search,</p></div><div class="section"><p>and gaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. Additionally, our Microsoft Experience Centers are</p></div><div class="section"><p>designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.</p></div></div><h2>Distributors and Resellers</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (“LSP”),</p></div><div class="section"><p>distributors, value-added resellers (“VAR”), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach</p></div><div class="section"><p>organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs,</p></div><div class="section"><p>and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as</p></div><div class="section"><p>resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for</p></div><div class="section"><p>reselling cloud services.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized</p></div><div class="section"><p>replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field</p></div><div class="section"><p>support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners</p></div><div class="section"><p>providing vertical solutions and specialized services.</p></div><div class="section"><p>27</p></div><div class="section"><p>LICENSING OPTIONS</p></div><div class="section"><p>We offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We</p></div><div class="section"><p>license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple</p></div><div class="section"><p>licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use</p></div><div class="section"><p>different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ</p></div><div class="section"><p>in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below.</p></div><div class="section"><p>SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also</p></div><div class="section"><p>provides support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently.</p></div><div class="section"><p>SA is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.</p></div></div><h2>Volume Licensing Programs</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Enterprise Agreement</p></div><div class="section"><p>Enterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the</p></div><div class="section"><p>flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement.

Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is included.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Microsoft Customer Agreement</p></div><div class="section"><p>A Microsoft Customer Agreement is a simplified purchase agreement presented, accepted, and stored through a</p></div><div class="section"><p>digital experience.

The agreement allows</p></div><div class="section"><p>customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Microsoft Products and Services Agreement</p></div><div class="section"><p>Microsoft Products and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license</p></div><div class="section"><p>cloud services and on-premises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single,</p></div><div class="section"><p>non-expiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for</p></div><div class="section"><p>customers that purchase perpetual licenses.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Open Value</p></div><div class="section"><p>Open Value agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. These</p></div><div class="section"><p>agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises</p></div><div class="section"><p>software over a three-year period. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual</p></div><div class="section"><p>licenses or subscribe to licenses and SA is included.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Select Plus</p></div><div class="section"><p>A Select Plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at</p></div><div class="section"><p>any affiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization.

Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly</p></div><div class="section"><p>provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions.</p></div><div class="section"><p>The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software</p></div><div class="section"><p>vendors who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted</p></div><div class="section"><p>applications to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based</p></div><div class="section"><p>on consumption.</p></div><div class="section"><p>The Independent Software Vendor Royalty Program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other</p></div><div class="section"><p>applications and then license the unified business solution to their end users.</p></div><div class="section"><p>CUSTOMERS</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector</p></div><div class="section"><p>institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our products</p></div><div class="section"><p>promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.</p></div><div class="section"><p>AVAILABLE INFORMATION</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our Internet address is www.microsoft.com.

We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. We</p></div><div class="section"><p>are creating the platforms and tools, powered by artificial intelligence (“AI”), that deliver better, faster, and more</p></div><div class="section"><p>effective solutions to support small and large business competitiveness, improve educational and health outcomes,</p></div><div class="section"><p>grow public-sector efficiency, and empower human ingenuity.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and</p></div><div class="section"><p>businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global</p></div><div class="section"><p>audience; and designing and selling devices.

At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad</p></div><div class="section"><p>range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers</p></div><div class="section"><p>and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.</p></div><div class="section"><p>30</p></div></div><h2>Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors</p></div><div class="section"><p>are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and</p></div><div class="section"><p>businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in</p></div><div class="section"><p>the cloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for</p></div><div class="section"><p>our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain</p></div><div class="section"><p>dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.</p></div><div class="section"><p>The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating</p></div><div class="section"><p>costs and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our</p></div><div class="section"><p>datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given</p></div><div class="section"><p>the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land,</p></div><div class="section"><p>predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other</p></div><div class="section"><p>components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our</p></div><div class="section"><p>products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet</p></div><div class="section"><p>our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified</p></div><div class="section"><p>suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet</p></div><div class="section"><p>consumer demand.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university</p></div><div class="section"><p>and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working</p></div><div class="section"><p>environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different</p></div><div class="section"><p>products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue</p></div><div class="section"><p>and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates</p></div><div class="section"><p>may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies</p></div><div class="section"><p>reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023.</p></div><div class="section"><p>On January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer</p></div><div class="section"><p>demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a</p></div><div class="section"><p>$1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (“Q2 charge”), which included employee severance</p></div><div class="section"><p>expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to</p></div><div class="section"><p>lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third</p></div><div class="section"><p>quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While</p></div><div class="section"><p>we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our</p></div><div class="section"><p>capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we</p></div><div class="section"><p>are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results</p></div><div class="section"><p>through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to</p></div><div class="section"><p>evaluate our real estate needs.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Refer to Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.</p></div></div><h2>Seasonality</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second</p></div><div class="section"><p>quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending</p></div><div class="section"><p>by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed</p></div><div class="section"><p>during the period.</p></div></div><h2>Change in Accounting Estimate</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to</p></div><div class="section"><p>investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as</p></div><div class="section"><p>31</p></div><div class="section"><p>advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network</p></div><div class="section"><p>equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of</p></div><div class="section"><p>June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of</p></div><div class="section"><p>$3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.</p></div></div><h2>Reportable Segments</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes,</p></div><div class="section"><p>Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.

This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S.</p></div><div class="section"><p>government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for</p></div><div class="section"><p>identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and</p></div><div class="section"><p>liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing</p></div><div class="section"><p>methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency</p></div><div class="section"><p>securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>municipal securities.

Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is</p></div><div class="section"><p>not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the</p></div><div class="section"><p>investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker</p></div><div class="section"><p>prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker</p></div><div class="section"><p>priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate</p></div><div class="section"><p>for these investments.

Preparing</p></div><div class="section"><p>consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported</p></div><div class="section"><p>amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a</p></div><div class="section"><p>significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of</p></div><div class="section"><p>operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment</p></div><div class="section"><p>securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.</p></div><div class="section"><p>42</p></div></div><h2>Revenue Recognition</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be</p></div><div class="section"><p>accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes</p></div><div class="section"><p>both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software</p></div><div class="section"><p>license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud</p></div><div class="section"><p>service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of</p></div><div class="section"><p>integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are</p></div><div class="section"><p>accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the</p></div><div class="section"><p>period in which the cloud services are provided.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation. We</p></div><div class="section"><p>use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with</p></div><div class="section"><p>SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell</p></div><div class="section"><p>each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated</p></div><div class="section"><p>based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.</p></div><div class="section"><p>In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we</p></div><div class="section"><p>determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically</p></div><div class="section"><p>have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services</p></div><div class="section"><p>by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and</p></div><div class="section"><p>geographic region in determining the SSP.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of</p></div><div class="section"><p>delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain</p></div><div class="section"><p>instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable</p></div><div class="section"><p>consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract</p></div><div class="section"><p>inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to</p></div><div class="section"><p>our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.</p></div></div><h2>Impairment of Investment Securities</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair</p></div><div class="section"><p>value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the</p></div><div class="section"><p>extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this</p></div><div class="section"><p>judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in</p></div><div class="section"><p>evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to</p></div><div class="section"><p>the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely</p></div><div class="section"><p>than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is</p></div><div class="section"><p>recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is</p></div><div class="section"><p>established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment</p></div><div class="section"><p>indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform</p></div><div class="section"><p>a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to</p></div><div class="section"><p>determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment</p></div><div class="section"><p>charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.</p></div></div><h2>Goodwill</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business</p></div><div class="section"><p>combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative</p></div><div class="section"><p>43</p></div><div class="section"><p>fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or</p></div><div class="section"><p>one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or</p></div><div class="section"><p>circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying</p></div><div class="section"><p>value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors,</p></div><div class="section"><p>operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units,</p></div><div class="section"><p>assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination</p></div><div class="section"><p>of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of</p></div><div class="section"><p>a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash</p></div><div class="section"><p>flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business,</p></div><div class="section"><p>estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of</p></div><div class="section"><p>capital.</p></div><div class="section"><p>The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating</p></div><div class="section"><p>results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the</p></div><div class="section"><p>determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.</p></div></div><h2>Research and Development Costs</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until</p></div><div class="section"><p>technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software</p></div><div class="section"><p>costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in</p></div><div class="section"><p>determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological</p></div><div class="section"><p>feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through</p></div><div class="section"><p>coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of</p></div><div class="section"><p>these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.</p></div></div><h2>Legal and Other Contingencies</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An</p></div><div class="section"><p>estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is</p></div><div class="section"><p>probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be</p></div><div class="section"><p>reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the</p></div><div class="section"><p>degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of</p></div><div class="section"><p>loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.</p></div></div><h2>Income Taxes</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the</p></div><div class="section"><p>current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been</p></div><div class="section"><p>recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax</p></div><div class="section"><p>position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing</p></div><div class="section"><p>authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements</p></div><div class="section"><p>from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being</p></div><div class="section"><p>realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax</p></div><div class="section"><p>assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties</p></div><div class="section"><p>associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax</p></div><div class="section"><p>consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations</p></div><div class="section"><p>in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial</p></div><div class="section"><p>statements.</p></div><div class="section"><p>44</p></div></div><h2>Inventories</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials,</p></div><div class="section"><p>labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the</p></div><div class="section"><p>estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review</p></div><div class="section"><p>inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our</p></div><div class="section"><p>inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans,</p></div><div class="section"><p>current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below</p></div><div class="section"><p>carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.</p></div><div class="section"><p>45</p></div></div><h2>STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that</p></div><div class="section"><p>are presented in this report.

with accounting</p></div><div class="section"><p>principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).</p></div><div class="section"><p>We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior</p></div><div class="section"><p>period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or</p></div><div class="section"><p>consolidated cash flows statements.</p></div></div><h2>Principles of Consolidation</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.</p></div></div><h2>Estimates and Assumptions</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported</p></div><div class="section"><p>amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue</p></div><div class="section"><p>recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the</p></div><div class="section"><p>standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as</p></div><div class="section"><p>product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of</p></div><div class="section"><p>goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible</p></div><div class="section"><p>assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based</p></div><div class="section"><p>compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of</p></div><div class="section"><p>uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and</p></div><div class="section"><p>determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from</p></div><div class="section"><p>management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.</p></div><div class="section"><p>In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to</p></div><div class="section"><p>investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as</p></div><div class="section"><p>advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network</p></div><div class="section"><p>equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of</p></div><div class="section"><p>June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of</p></div><div class="section"><p>$3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.</p></div></div><h2>Foreign Currencies</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation</p></div><div class="section"><p>adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.</p></div></div><h2>Revenue</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue</p></div><div class="section"><p>Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications,</p></div><div class="section"><p>server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development</p></div><div class="section"><p>tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices,</p></div><div class="section"><p>and related accessories.</p></div><div class="section"><p>53</p></div><div class="section"><p>Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services,</p></div><div class="section"><p>platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Revenue Recognition</p></div><div class="section"><p>Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that</p></div><div class="section"><p>reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts</p></div><div class="section"><p>that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and</p></div><div class="section"><p>accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any</p></div><div class="section"><p>taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.</p></div></div><h2>Nature of Products and Services</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made</p></div><div class="section"><p>available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide</p></div><div class="section"><p>customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the</p></div><div class="section"><p>software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is</p></div><div class="section"><p>made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the</p></div><div class="section"><p>updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally</p></div><div class="section"><p>ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with</p></div><div class="section"><p>Software Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and</p></div><div class="section"><p>provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises</p></div><div class="section"><p>licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally</p></div><div class="section"><p>recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that</p></div><div class="section"><p>SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of</p></div><div class="section"><p>the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided</p></div><div class="section"><p>on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on</p></div><div class="section"><p>a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer</p></div><div class="section"><p>utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with</p></div><div class="section"><p>software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in</p></div><div class="section"><p>which the cloud services are provided.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the</p></div><div class="section"><p>action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as</p></div><div class="section"><p>services are provided.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot</p></div><div class="section"><p>function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a</p></div><div class="section"><p>single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to</p></div><div class="section"><p>resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Refer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by</p></div><div class="section"><p>significant product and service offering.</p></div></div><h2>Significant Judgments</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be</p></div><div class="section"><p>54</p></div><div class="section"><p>accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes</p></div><div class="section"><p>both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software</p></div><div class="section"><p>license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud</p></div><div class="section"><p>service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of</p></div><div class="section"><p>integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are</p></div><div class="section"><p>accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the</p></div><div class="section"><p>period in which the cloud services are provided.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to</p></div><div class="section"><p>estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates</p></div><div class="section"><p>provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and</p></div><div class="section"><p>services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of</p></div><div class="section"><p>the various products and services.</p></div><div class="section"><p>In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we</p></div><div class="section"><p>determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically</p></div><div class="section"><p>have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services</p></div><div class="section"><p>by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and</p></div><div class="section"><p>geographic region in determining the SSP.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of</p></div><div class="section"><p>delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain</p></div><div class="section"><p>instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable</p></div><div class="section"><p>consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract</p></div><div class="section"><p>inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available.

We record a receivable when</p></div><div class="section"><p>revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.</p></div><div class="section"><p>For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage</p></div><div class="section"><p>period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an</p></div><div class="section"><p>unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA</p></div><div class="section"><p>and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for</p></div><div class="section"><p>multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments</p></div><div class="section"><p>for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox</p></div><div class="section"><p>subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have</p></div><div class="section"><p>been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Refer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes</p></div><div class="section"><p>in unearned revenue during the period.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment</p></div><div class="section"><p>within 30 to 60 days.

We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the</p></div><div class="section"><p>requirements to be capitalized.

For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected</p></div><div class="section"><p>product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The</p></div><div class="section"><p>specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we</p></div><div class="section"><p>do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For</p></div><div class="section"><p>software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of</p></div><div class="section"><p>the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and</p></div><div class="section"><p>adjust the amounts as necessary.</p></div></div><h2>Research and Development</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also</p></div><div class="section"><p>include third-party development and programming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and</p></div><div class="section"><p>services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense</p></div><div class="section"><p>until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before</p></div><div class="section"><p>the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and</p></div><div class="section"><p>amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.</p></div></div><h2>Sales and Marketing</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other</p></div><div class="section"><p>headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising,</p></div><div class="section"><p>promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising</p></div><div class="section"><p>expense was $904 million, $1.5 billion, and $1.5 billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.</p></div></div><h2>Stock-Based Compensation</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units</p></div><div class="section"><p>(“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures,</p></div><div class="section"><p>over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our</p></div><div class="section"><p>common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting</p></div><div class="section"><p>period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is</p></div><div class="section"><p>recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is</p></div><div class="section"><p>entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.</p></div></div><h2>Employee Severance</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>On January 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs</p></div><div class="section"><p>through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded</p></div><div class="section"><p>$800 million of employee severance expenses related to these job eliminations as part of an ongoing employee</p></div><div class="section"><p>benefit plan. These employee severance expenses were incurred as part of a corporate program, and were included</p></div><div class="section"><p>in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated income statements and allocated to our segments based</p></div><div class="section"><p>on relative gross margin. Refer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information.</p></div><div class="section"><p>57</p></div></div><h2>Income Taxes</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax</p></div><div class="section"><p>positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year.</p></div><div class="section"><p>The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported</p></div><div class="section"><p>net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income</p></div><div class="section"><p>taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.</p></div></div><h2>Financial Instruments</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Investments</p></div><div class="section"><p>We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of</p></div><div class="section"><p>purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general,</p></div><div class="section"><p>investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are</p></div><div class="section"><p>classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term</p></div><div class="section"><p>based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is</p></div><div class="section"><p>available for current operations.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific</p></div><div class="section"><p>identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other</p></div><div class="section"><p>comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates</p></div><div class="section"><p>determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors,</p></div><div class="section"><p>general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than</p></div><div class="section"><p>cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and</p></div><div class="section"><p>qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be</p></div><div class="section"><p>required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment</p></div><div class="section"><p>charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/</p></div><div class="section"><p>or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without</p></div><div class="section"><p>readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for</p></div><div class="section"><p>observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative</p></div><div class="section"><p>assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the</p></div><div class="section"><p>investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Derivatives</p></div><div class="section"><p>Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for</p></div><div class="section"><p>changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.</p></div><div class="section"><p>For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income</p></div><div class="section"><p>(expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge</p></div><div class="section"><p>components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.</p></div><div class="section"><p>For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of</p></div><div class="section"><p>other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding</p></div><div class="section"><p>hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are</p></div><div class="section"><p>recognized in other income (expense), net.</p></div><div class="section"><p>For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are</p></div><div class="section"><p>primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.</p></div><div class="section"><p>58</p></div></div><h2>Fair Value Measurements</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on</p></div><div class="section"><p>the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair</p></div><div class="section"><p>value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value</p></div><div class="section"><p>measurement in its entirety. These levels are:</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our</p></div><div class="section"><p>Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual</p></div><div class="section"><p>funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for</p></div><div class="section"><p>identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g.</p></div><div class="section"><p>the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be</p></div><div class="section"><p>corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where</p></div><div class="section"><p>applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using</p></div><div class="section"><p>market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of</p></div><div class="section"><p>deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities,</p></div><div class="section"><p>corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include</p></div><div class="section"><p>certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions</p></div><div class="section"><p>that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined</p></div><div class="section"><p>using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our</p></div><div class="section"><p>Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and</p></div><div class="section"><p>goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment</p></div><div class="section"><p>charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of</p></div><div class="section"><p>these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may</p></div><div class="section"><p>include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying</p></div><div class="section"><p>values.</p></div></div><h2>Inventories</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials,</p></div><div class="section"><p>labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the</p></div><div class="section"><p>estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review</p></div><div class="section"><p>inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our</p></div><div class="section"><p>inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost</p></div><div class="section"><p>basis through a charge to cost of revenue.</p></div></div><h2>Property and Equipment</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line</p></div><div class="section"><p>method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our</p></div><div class="section"><p>property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three</p></div><div class="section"><p>years; computer equipment, two to six years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements,</p></div><div class="section"><p>three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.</p></div></div><h2>Leases</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use</p></div><div class="section"><p>(“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance</p></div><div class="section"><p>59</p></div><div class="section"><p>leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our</p></div><div class="section"><p>consolidated balance sheets.</p></div><div class="section"><p>ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our</p></div><div class="section"><p>obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized</p></div><div class="section"><p>at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do</p></div><div class="section"><p>not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest</p></div><div class="section"><p>for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease</p></div><div class="section"><p>ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include</p></div><div class="section"><p>options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease</p></div><div class="section"><p>expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.</p></div><div class="section"><p>We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For</p></div><div class="section"><p>certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease</p></div><div class="section"><p>component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the</p></div><div class="section"><p>operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.</p></div></div><h2>Goodwill</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating</p></div><div class="section"><p>segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that</p></div><div class="section"><p>would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.</p></div></div><h2>Intangible Assets</h2><div class="section"><div class="section"><p>Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their</p></div><div class="section"><p>estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets</p></div><div class="section"><p>periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that</p></div><div class="section"><p>indicate the asset may be impaired.</p></div><div class="section"><p>NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE</p></div><div class="section"><p>Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock</p></div><div class="section"><p>outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of</p></div><div class="section"><p>common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury</p></div><div class="section"><p>stock method.

for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud</p></div><div class="section"><p>based services.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized</p></div><div class="section"><p>(e.g., variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services).</p></div><div class="section"><p>• Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and</p></div><div class="section"><p>services that are not sold separately.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Given

class="section"><p>determination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• We evaluated management’s significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for</p></div><div class="section"><p>reasonableness.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:</p></div><div class="section"><p>- Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other</p></div><div class="section"><p>documents that were part of the agreement.</p></div><div class="section"><p>- Tested management’s identification and treatment of contract terms.</p></div><div class="section"><p>-

estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition</p></div><div class="section"><p>conclusions.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and</p></div><div class="section"><p>services that are not sold separately.</p></div><div class="section"><p>• We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of</p></div><div class="section"><p>revenue recognized in the financial statements.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Income Taxes –

Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the</p></div><div class="section"><p>reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally</p></div><div class="section"><p>accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that</p></div><div class="section"><p>in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions</p></div><div class="section"><p>are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance</p></div><div class="section"><p>that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and</p></div><div class="section"><p>providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have</p></div><div class="section"><p>a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because</p></div><div class="section"><p>of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that</p></div><div class="section"><p>a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected.</p></div><div class="section"><p>Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on</p></div><div class="section"><p>the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring</p></div><div class="section"><p>Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
